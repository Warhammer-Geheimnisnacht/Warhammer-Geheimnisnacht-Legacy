creature_amazon;Amazon;;;;;;;;;;x
creature_amazon_desc;This person is from one of the Amazon tribes of Lustria. Not much is known about the Amazons, except that they are a strictly matriarchal society, and have some ties to the old ones. Being insular bordering on paranoid, it is unlikely that much more will be known about them any time soon. Most men who enter their domain are never heard from again.;;;;;;;;;;x
complacent;Complacent;;;;;;;;;;;;;
complacent_desc;This Amazon doesn't care about hunting and fighting, but rather spends her time slacking off in her palace, living of the prestige of her family rather than increase it. If she's kept around, she will increase the Complacency value of her dynasty, giving a bad name to all of her relatives.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
disinherited_amazon;Unworthy;;;;;;;;;;;;;
disinherited_amazon_desc;This character, due to being a male or a disgraced huntress, has been deemed unworthy by Amazonian society and is therefore not allowed to hold any position of power within it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

exile_complacent_amazon;Exile Tame Amazon;;;;;;;;;;;;;
exile_complacent_amazon_desc;Rigg teaches Amazons to be fierce and ruthelss, that is the only way for a woman to survive and be free. If [Root.GetFirstName] has grown complacent, there is only one way to have her find again her spirit or die trying.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
amazon_brawling_tournament;Hold a Ritual to Rigg;;;;;;;;;;;;;
amazon_brawling_tournament_desc;Invite your sisters to a great tournament organized to celebrate strength and skill in fighting and thus please the Goddesses of War. Be sure to have enough young, able-bodied Amazons in your court and amongst your vassals before issuing this command, since, if there are not enough participants willing to fight, you won't be able to issue another tournament for a few years.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
#
# AMAZON EVENTS
#
amazon5B;No, let these ones keep roaming free;;;;;;;;;;;;x
amazon8desc;Once each spring, it is allowed for all Amazons of any caste to mate with men so that new daughters can be born. Do you wish to host a fertility ritual, and put your captive male population to good use?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
amazon8A;Yes, let the ritual be prepared!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
amazon8B;No, maybe next year...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
amazon9desc;Rigg, Goddess of War and Battle does not normally tolerate men in her realm, but tonight her sister Serena will allow an exception. The drums beat, the pace of the dance increases, and as the wine flows, your ceremonial husband for one night is brought before you in chains along with many others for your gathered sisters. You may do as you wish with him and if he does not please you, the Snake-Goddess Serena will welcome his sacrifice after he has performed his final duty for the Amazon Sisterhood!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
amazon9A;Come with me, slave...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
amazon10desc;While lying in the prison cell you hear the drums beat, the pace of the dance increases, the laughter upstairs in the palace grow increasingly wild as the wine no doubt flows. Fierce Amazon spearmaidens soon arrive to put you in chains and drag up to the hall along with the others. You are soon brought before an Amazon Priestess, and she leads you towards her private quarters... you have heard rumours that men who displease them during the fertility rites are sacrificed, so your heart is pumping out of your chest...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
amazon10A;Must ... not... disappoint her!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
amazon11desc;You wake up with a smile on your face, sighing contentedly. The slave performed well last night, and you are inclined to let him live on. Yet on the other hand, Serena favours those who sacrifice in her name... especially things they place value on.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
amazon11A;Another time perhaps. For now, this one lives.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
amazon11B;A life for a life, Serena will have his blood!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
amazon12desc;You wake up with a sneer awoken by the slave's snoring, still tied to your bed. You remember his pathetic performance last night, and the blood lust begins to boil in your veins...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
amazon12A;No, I'm going to be merciful.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
amazon12B;At least I'll enjoy sacrificing this one, and hearing his screams.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
amazon13desc;You wake up tied to the Priestess's bed, and find her smiling down on you. 'Good slave,' she whispers, 'I hope the others let you live too, and I get you next year as well...';;;;;;;;;;;;x
amazon13A;Thank the gods, I'm going to live!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
amazon14desc;You wake up tied to the Priestess's bed, and find her sneering face looking down on you. Without a word, you are knocked unconscious by the hilt of a wicked looking dagger and when you come to... you are in the great hall, kneeling before the high priestess. Drums are beating, your head is pounding, Amazons are dancing and cheering behind you, and then a sharp cold pain is felt against your throat. You have no time to scream as the last things you see is a spray of blood pouring out on the ground from your throat!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
amazon14A;Ugghhhh!!!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
amazon15desc;The sacrifices to Serena are brought before the throne. These men have proven themselves worthless. The drums are beating, your sisters are dancing around them, and cheers emanate from the sides of the great hall. Finally you step down behind the slave you bedded last night, savour the look of terror on his face, and then swiftly draw the sacrificial dagger as you move behind him and spray his lifeblood all over the floor. The Creators be praised, let this sacrifice please the Snake-Goddess!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
amazon15A;Serena be praised!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
amazon17desc;In the eyes of the world, your child is a bastard, but in Amazon culture that is not so. Your child is your legitimate heir, no matter who the father is.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
amazon17A;That is the proper way of things.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
amazon18desc;You have been told previously that you are an exception, and do not have to be a slave in the Amazon hierarchy. Yet you find yourself in prison along with the others...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
amazon18A;I will appeal to my jailers!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
amazon19desc;You are asked to visit one of your captives in the dungeon. He looks at you appealingly: 'Please, I was promised that I was an exception and could roam freely... why am I locked up here with all the others?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
amazon19A;Ahh, that is correct my pet. Sisters, release this one!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
amazon19B;We lied. You will stay where you belong.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
amazon20desc;Your host comes down to your cell, and smiles at your predicament. 'You're right, pet, we did say you could walk freely. Sisters - release this one at once!';;;;;;;;;;;;x
amazon20A;Thank you!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
amazon21desc;Your host comes down to your cell, and smiles at your predicament. 'Remember when we said that you could walk freely amongst us? We lied.' With that, the Amazons laugh darkly and leave you alone once more.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
amazon21A;Wait, please, come back!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
amazon22desc;Your top liege is an Amazon, and in Amazon realms men are forbidden from holding or inheriting titles unless they are a very rare exception.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
amazon22A;Curse this unjust and purely socially constructed order!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
amazon23desc;Your top liege is no longer Amazon, so you can now inherit normally again.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
amazon23A;Gender equality at last!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
amazon0desc;As a member of the Amazon people, your succession must be enatic. Males cannot be allowed to threaten the ruling order by holding independent power.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
amazon5desc;One or more males are running around freely in your court. This cannot be allowed to stand. They must be sent to the guarded male dorms immediately and put to good use!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
amazon5A;Yes, immediately!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
amazon6desc;You have walked as a free man amongst the Amazons, but no more. A group of spear maidens seize you, and on orders of their mistress, drag you to the dungeons where a new life of slavery awaits you.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
amazon6A;Nooo!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
amazon7desc;You have given birth to a male child. By the laws of your people, he must either be prepared for sacrifice, or slavery.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
amazon7A;He will be sent to the dungeons and be a slave.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
amazon7B;This one will be sacrificed.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
amazon7C;I *am* the law! My sons will live free amongst us.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAsamazonchild2001;You're finally old enough to start your Amazon training and you couldn't be more excited. You've heard a lot of the exploits of the older sisters of your tribe and can't wait to be a proper huntress.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild2001;Yes!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild2002;You're finally old enough to start your Amazon training, but, although you have good intentions, it seems you just can't manage to keep up with the tasks that are assigned to you. It's as if you're not strong enough to be a proper Amazon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild2002;I must make it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild2003;You've been battered with all this nonsense about female supremacy and Amazonian toughness and bravery from your entire childhood. Now you should start training to become like all the other brainwashed sisters, but the truth is, you've no intention to comply with any of this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild2003;I'll find my own path!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild3001;Your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] sure looks excited to start [From.GetHerHis] training and become a proper Amazon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild3001;That's the spirit!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsamazonchild3001;Then she can work it out on her own;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild3002;Your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] should start to train as a proper Amazon, she's old enough to do it, but she really doesn't seem to have what it takes, regardless of her efforts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild3002;We'll just have to try harder.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsamazonchild3002;She's a lost cause.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild3003;Your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] should start to train as a proper Amazon, but she seems to resist every attempt at teaching her the superior values of your culture, ignoring or criticizing anything her elders tell her.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild3003;I'll whip her in place.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsamazonchild3003;She's a lost cause.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild4;You're finally out in the wilderness, following the your elder sisters in the hunts. The Jungle is a scary and dangerous place, but you're growing more confident at each expedition.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild4;I'm not scared of the dark trees!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild4001;You've started sending your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] out with some of the huntresses, so that she may start learning how to stalk the easier game. The little Amazons seems to be going fine, growing confident in her skills.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild4001;*Encourage her*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsamazonchild4001;*Berate her for her recklessness*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCsamazonchild4001;*Ignore her*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild4002;[From.GetFirstName] listened to your more recent experiences in the jungle with great interest and complimented you for your bravery in the face of the dangerous task you were part of.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild4002;I'll be the best Amazon ever!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild4003;[From.GetFirstName] listened to your more recent experiences in the jungle, but she didn't look very happy about it. She disciplined you for your recklessness, telling you an Amazon, even if without fear, shouldn't brazenly go against any danger without thinking.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild4003;But I thought..?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild4004;[From.GetFirstName] barely listened to your more recent experiences in the jungle. It seems your steady heart was not enough to obtain her approval.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild4004;What else can I do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild4005;Your [GetFromRelation] was very excited of your praise and promised to keep pushing her limits more and more at every next expedition.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild4005;Good girl.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild4006;Your [GetFromRelation] was saddened by your disapproval. She has started to act more cautiously, sometimes even trying to aviod going out with the huntresses, but it's hard to say if it'll stick.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild4006;It better be.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild4007;Your [GetFromRelation] seemed to have interpreted your lack of interest as displeasure. She keeps going hunting with her elder sisters, but is growing more and more frustrated in her attempts to impress you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild4007;That's good for her.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild5;Training alongside other girls, competing with each other, going out with the elders to learn how to hunt, everything is making you feel more open and included amongst your sisters. You might not be related by blood, but you share a kindred spirit and only together can you survive in the jungle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild5;We're in this together.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild5001;Your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] is growing more talkative and friendly. Spending a lot of time with other girls of her age, talking and training together has opened her and allowed her to find a place in the younger community.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild5001;*Encourage her*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsamazonchild5001;*Berate her for not focusing on her training*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCsamazonchild5001;*Ignore her*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild5002;Your [GetFromRelation] seems very pleased of seeing you interact and make friends with the other young Amazons, teaching you about the importance of friendship and cohoperation amongst the daughters of Serena.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild5002;I'm glad to be a part of this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild5003;Your [GetFromRelation] has disciplined you today for wasting so much time with your friends in useless activities, when you should have focused only on your training. You are training to become a strong ruler, the other girls are not your allies, they're in competition with you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild5003;I.. I won't forget this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild5004;Your [GetFromRelation] doesn't really seem to mind of your friends and the time you spend with them. You're not sure if this is a good or a bad sign. The other girls told you not to worry about it, but you're unsure what to make of it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild5004;Is it.. good? Bad?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild5005;Your [GetFromRelation] was emboldened by your acceptance of her new friends and has started spending more and more time out, training, talking, becoming her own woman.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild5005;I'm proud of her.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild5006;Your [GetFromRelation] was confused at first by your complaints about her behavior, but has now slowly started to avoid her new friends, trying to focus entirely on her training.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild5006;She better keep at it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild5007;Your [GetFromRelation] still spends a lot of time with her friends. With your lack in interest in her situation, she has started to rely on them to get her opinion from.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild5007;Hm, whatever.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild6;You really want to become a strong and famous Amazon when you grow up, but this training is just exhausting. Since some time now, you've tried to avoid some of the sessions, just to take some time to rest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild6;I'm not really lazy;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild6001;Despite her willingness to train and her staunch trust in the Amazonian ways, [From.GetFirstName] has grown lazy in the last weeks. She might have been excused for a few days, but now it's becoming too much. She's not going to grow into a fit and able woman by sitting on her behind.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild6001;*Enable her*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsamazonchild6001;*Berate her for her lazyness*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCsamazonchild6001;*Ignore her*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild6002;You were relieved to hear from your [GetFromRelation] there's nothing wrong in taking some breaks between training. You'll just lay back for a while, recover your forces, and start your training, good as new.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild6002;Just a few more days;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild6003;Your [GetFromRelation] was not as understanding as you expected of your time off. She dragged you off your room this morning and had you run across the village from the entire day as a first compensation for your lost time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild6003;But I'm so tired!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild6004;Your [GetFromRelation] has not complained about your time off of training for now. On the other hand, you are starting to feel a bit guilty about waisting so many days. Perhaps it's time to go back to your previous schedule.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild6004;Yes, maybe so;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild6005;Your [GetFromRelation] was relieved by your understanding of her needs. She now spends even more time skipping sessions and slacking at home, sleeping or eating for most of the day.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild6005;Perhaps I should have been more strict;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild6006;You made clear your stance to your [GetFromRelation]. Hopefully she has learned now to not slack off on her training. Especially if you are her trainer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild6006;She'd better have.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild6007;Your [GetFromRelation] still tends to waste more time at home than she should. Hopefully she'll grow tired of it eventually and get back on schedule for her training.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild6007;Whenever she feels more comfortable;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild6008;You've lost track of most of the friends you made in training, but you've found other at home, to spend days speaking. It was already for the best to stop training. Even though you might have gained a little weight, at least you don't have to drag yourself home exhausted every night...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild6008;Hmm;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild6009;All this slacking off and skipping training and hunts is not being good for [From.GetFirstName]. She's grown lazy and fat, wasting her days sitting on her growing behind.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild6009;That's pitiful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild7;Sometime it's friendly fights, sometimes.. not. But you like it, whether you win or lose, in the end it's all for your benefit and the training right? ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild7;It's just costing a tooth every while;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild7001;Your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] is growing into quite the spirited girl, picking fights with the other trainees, returning home half of the times with a sore eye or a missing tooth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild7001;*Encourage her*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsamazonchild7001;*Berate her*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCsamazonchild7001;*Ignore her*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild7002;You were excited to hear of your [GetFromRelation]'s approval of your belligerant attitude. Not that it would matter, after all, if she said anything against it, you would have made her change her mind, one way or the other.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild7002;Damn right!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild7003;You were very upset when your [GetFromRelation] yelled at you for acting so violently for such allegedly insignificant reasons. You would have striked her, if she didn't look so scary.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild7003;Maybe next time I will!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild7004;Your [GetFromRelation] has ignored your black eyes for now. You're fine with it, after all, what's her business what you do when you're out? You just need to get better at it, that way only the other girls will return sore at their home.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild7004;That's it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild7005;[From.GetFirstName] seemed very happy for your endorsement. Last day she started a fight with a girl two years older just to impress you as you were passing by. She didn't win, but still, it was a notable brawl.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild7005;That's my girl!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild7006;[From.GetFirstName] was as furious as you were when you disciplined her about keeping her nerves in check. It was a bad evening, but hopefully she has learned her lession.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild7006;It better be so.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild7007;[From.GetFirstName] is keeping to get in some nasty fights. At this point it might be just to catch your attention, as you could swear she's getting more and more violent against her unlucky victims.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild7007;So what?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild8;You just can't help it: you do your best, but every time you get into a fight, the other girls end up beating you. Some of the other young Amazons have started purposefully picking up on you, to the point you've become afraid of even leaving your home to go training anymore.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild8;I don't wanna!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild8001;Some girls have started picking up on your [GetFromRelation], beating and mocking her for her weakly demeanor. They have no fault, of course, but [From.GetFirstName] rather than toughen up and answer in kind, seems to be growing more and more craven.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild8001;*Enable her*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsamazonchild8001;*Berate her for her cowardice*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCsamazonchild8001;*Ignore her*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild8002;[From.GetFirstName] was very understanding with you, giving a hard talk to the other mean girls and allowing you to spend some days home from time to time. It's a little embarassing to be protected by a grown up, but at least you're not getting beaten anymore.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild8002;Yes, at least that;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild8003;Your [GetFromRelation] proved to be no more understanding than those bullies: she striked and disciplined you, telling you the problem is not with them but with you and that you must be strong if you want to ever become a true Amazon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild8003;But..!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild8004;Your [GetFromRelation] doesn't really seem to care about your problems. She barely listened when you told her about the bullies and dismissed the whole thing as something for you to solve on your own.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild8004;But..!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild8005;Reassuring and helping [From.GetFirstName] with those bullies certainly calmed her down, although you wonder if this will help her in the long run becoming a good Amazon;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild8005;At least she feels safe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild8006;The bullies are still picking up on [From.GetFirstName], but at least now she answers in kind from time to time. Hopefully she'll manage to get over it, eventually.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild8006;She better be.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild8007;You don't know what is happening with [From.GetFirstName] and those bullies, nor you care. Probably things are still bad, giving a look on how she comes back home in the evening.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild8007;Well, that's on her.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild9;There are so many things that you can do wrong and having all the eyes of the other better trainees pointed on you make you just feel uncomfortable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild9;Can't I train alone?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild9001;Your [GetFromRelation] is going through a streak of shyness it appears. She feels insecure and fears the judgement of her peers, thus trying to avoid any social meating with the girls of her age.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild9001;*Enable her*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsamazonchild9001;*Berate her for her cowardice*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCsamazonchild9001;*Ignore her*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild9002;You're glad your [GetFromRelation] is allowing you your space in this delicate time. There's nothing wrong with you after all, you just like to be alone for now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild9002;There's nothing wrong at all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild9003;Your [GetFromRelation] acted really mean in these days, trying to force you to train with the other girls, embarassing you and putting you on the spot. You don't know how could you possibly ever fight alongside this strangers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild9003;I just want to be left alone!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild9004;Your [GetFromRelation] is ignoring you, you couldn't ask for anything better. If she doesn't call you up on your shyness, then why should anyone else? Or why should you care about it if they do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild9004;Good, good;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild9005;Enabling [From.GetFirstName] might not have been a good idea. While she seems more calm now that she's not pressured into social activities, she might be losing on some fundamental lessons on the Amazonian way of life. If she's ever to become a leader, she can't keep hiding behind you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild9005;We'll see;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild9006;Forcing [From.GetFirstName] into the social life of a girl her age might be troubling for her now, but you're confident she will learn a valuable lesson and become accustomed to work and fight alongside other Amazons.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild9006;Exactly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild9007;[From.GetFirstName] still keeps for herself, trying to avoid other girls of her age, always remaining in silent unless explicitly asked something.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild9007;That's on her.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild10;You knew it would happen. You tried really hard, but you knew deep down that you were not worthy: today you fought with some other sisters during your training and ended up being seriously injured.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild10;And we weren't even using real weapons!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild10001;This is terrible. [From.GetFirstName] somehow managed to get hurt in a training today without even using real weapons. Now she's in her room, moaping, with her arm wrapped in leaves and cloth, incapacitated for at least a week.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild10001;*Let her recover*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsamazonchild10001;*Force her to train anyway*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCsamazonchild10001;*Ignore her*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild10002;You were relieved to know your [GetFromRelation] would allow you a full recovery before sending you back to training. At least she was understanding of your pain. Perhaps next time you'll do better.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild10002;Yes!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild10003;Nobody could have denied the gravity of your injury, yet [From.GetFirstName] was ready to kick you back into the fields before even a week. The arm still hurts really badly, but you must ignore the pain and keep exercising.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild10003;Hnn.. It hurts!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild10004;Your [GetFromRelation] did not even visit you once. On one hand, at least you're being left to heal in peace, on the other your own [GetFromRelation] knows you're suffering and still doesn't feel like visiting you at all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild10004;Does she hates me so much?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild10005;[From.GetFirstName] was relieved of hearing you would have let her heal without fretting her. Now she's fully recovered and ready to return to her training.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild10005;Good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild10006;[From.GetFirstName] still hurts and sometimes returns home bleeding from her wound, but what are you supposed to do? A true Amazon must learn to ignore the pain and fight her way through, that's what's what.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild10006;No doubt about it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild10007;You'd think letting her rot in that bed without bothering her would have at least made her happy, but [From.GetFirstName] seems still sad for some reason beyond the wound.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild10007;That's her problem.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild11;You try your best, but everything turns out wrong for you. You just can't manage to make it as an Amazon. It's all wrong, everybody is against you. You just want to dig a hole and die.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild11;I want to dieee!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild11001;[From.GetFirstName] has grown so frustrated by her recent failures during the training she's started spending her nights brooding and crying in a corner of her room. While she's right to be ashamed of herself, this is hardly the way she'll solve her problems.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild11001;*Enable her*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsamazonchild11001;*Berate her for her weakness*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCsamazonchild11001;*Ignore her*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild11002;You don't want to go out, you don't want to train. Your [GetFromRelation] might have tried to be nice with you, but it only made you feel even more ashamed. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild11002;There is no point in going on;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild11003;Life is so unfair. Your [GetFromRelation] wouldn't even grant you to sleep to death and dragged you out, forcing you into the training sessions once more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild11003;Noo! Let me die!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild11004;[From.GetFirstName] ignores your pain, but why shouldn't she? You are pathetic after all. A useless reject of an Amazon who will never accomplish anything.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild11004;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild11005;You tried to be kind with [From.GetFirstName], but it might have ended up in the opposite of the desired effect: she still wastes herself away in solitude and self-loathing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild11005;That's a lost cause.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild11006;[From.GetFirstName] maybe crying and moping, but at least she has a reason to now. You will keep on pushing her out physically for as long as needed until she gets her act up together.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild11006;Only way to be sure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild11007;Your [GetFromRelation] is still crying in some corner, probably. She really is a lost cause. She has the chance to learn from a great teacher and be an Amazon, what more does she need?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild11007;It's hopeless;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild11008;You've stopped going out altogether, you barely eat, you avoid the light and spend your nights crying at the moons. There is no point in going on. You never really had a chance at becoming an Amazon. That's the truth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild11008;It is;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild11009;[From.GetFirstName] is still brooding. She hasn't done any progress and all this laying motionless for days and skipping meals made her weak and sickly. This pale skeletrical creature has nothing of an Amazon's pride or look.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild11009;Nothing at all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild12;These ideas of having a society revolve entirely on war and violence is sick and wrong. You've taken your stand today on the field and refused to touch any of the training weapons. Sure, the teacher beat you and the other girls made fun of you, but you know you're standing for what's right.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild12;And I won't stand down!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild12001;That [From.GetFirstName] Today she refused to fight during the training session, standing up to the elders and ignoring her sisters' mocking her. The spoiled brat thinks dedicating her life to the art of war and hunt is a waste of time and, for some reason, 'wrong'.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild12001;Well, she makes some good points;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsamazonchild12001;What!?! Violence is a sacred principle of our society!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCsamazonchild12001;Psh, that won't make her last long, for sure;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild12002;You were suprised when your [GetFromRelation] supported your stance. Perhpas not all grownups are dumb, violent she-beasts as you thought.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild12002;Maybe I can find others who agree with me! Change the system!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild12003;It didn't really come as a surprise when your [GetFromRelation] started shouting and pulling you around for your behavior in the field. She's like all the others, blinded by bigotry and anger. It just frustrates you to no end to have to share your life with such troglodites.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild12003;I'd rather die than be you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild12004;You expected more of a fuss from your [GetFromRelation] after your behavior in the fields. It seems she has decided to just ignore you. Like you'd care what she thinks, if she ever thinks at all in that numb skull of hers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild12004;I'll just find someone who WILL listen to me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild12005;[From.GetFirstName] is really set in her ideas it seems. Now that you conceded her some points, she won't stop talking about how the whole way of living of Amazonia is skewed and wrong. She even found other girls in the tribe who share her ideas and started spredding this impure thoughts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild12005;That's.. hm, that's not very good...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild12006;It's like talking to a wall. Your [GetFromRelation] won't just understand the basic principle that being unable to defend yourself in Lustria means dying young. She thinks it'd be better for her to die with her ideas than learn out to throw a spear. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild12006;That's just stupid!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild12007;[From.GetFirstName] is still spewing her nonsense about peaceful coexistance and non-violence. You won't dignify any of that rubbish, of course.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild12007;Let her have at it, she'll come around;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild13;It just hit you: what's the point of training at all? All Amazons train for is fighting, to breed more senseless violence, cultivating an absurd standard of living and body. Why should you sweat and suffer for it when you think it's wrong? You should break tradition!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild13;No more training!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild13001;Having to put up with her seditious ideas was already enough, but now [From.GetFirstName] has decided to just stop training entirely! She thinks it cultivates a sick and unobtainable standard, whatever that means.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild13001;Maybe she has a point;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsamazonchild13001;One way or the other, she WILL sweat before night.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCsamazonchild13001;Whatever she says, I guess;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild13002;Your [GetFromRelation]'s support was unexpected, but no less pleasing. You must break the shackles of tradition, go completely against the ideal of Amazonian fitness. Which incidentally is something you really enjoy doing. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild13002;It's all for the good of our culture!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild13003;Your [GetFromRelation] had to fight and drag you on her back, kicking and screaming, to the fields to have you train again. She striked and yelled at you and did so much that, by the end of the day, you were more tired than you would have been if you trained. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild13003;And she's saying she'll do this every day!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild13004;Your [GetFromRelation] didn't say anything after your decision to stop training altogether. You know she's playing some trick with you, as if you could fall for it. You will keep doing what you feel it's right, to free Amazons from their primitive traditions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild13004;Yes!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild13005;[From.GetFirstName] spends her day at home, pontificating about the wrongness of Amazonian ideals while stuffing her face with the meat provided by restless huntresses and countless of hours of stalking. Perhaps it wasn't such a good idea to enable her.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild13005;She seemed so certain of it;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild13006;That's the only way to treat a spoiled child: violence. Sooner or later [From.GetFirstName] will understand that that should be her first, second and last answer to everything. For now, you're satisfied with having had her kick and scream and pull for the whole day.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild13006;Not training per se, but tiring enough.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild13007;[From.GetFirstName] can make all the excuses she wants for her lazyness, she's not going to sway you. If wasting her life accomplishing nothing is what she desire, then so be it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild13007;It's her life after all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild13008;You clean off some sauce from your bulging belly and go back at eating. It's amazing how quickly you managed to revert whatever effect the first training might have had on you. As you keep getting fatter each day, you show the true wrongness of Amazonian ideals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild13008;I'm sure of it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild13009;[From.GetFirstName] has really let herself go, following all those frivolous ideas about standards and abstract concepts. If she'd really been smart, she'd have trained along the other girls and become a strong and fit Amazon, rather than a bloated frog.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild13009;It's a lost cause.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild14;Not only Amazons spend all that time fighting and hunting, they force those poor males into prisons for no reason at all, using them like cattle and killing them without a tought nor mercy. These are creatures with feelings and emotions! You can connect with them, speak with them.. love them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild14;I do!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild14001;Nothing but blapshemy from [From.GetFirstName], as usual. Tonight she was found making out with one of the males in the stock. When you brought her own she had the gall to say she loved him and that she would free all of them one day.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild14001;It's a bad business, but.. It's the way things are.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsamazonchild14001;You don't know what you say, stupid girl!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCsamazonchild14001;Whatever, see if I care;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild14002;While [From.GetFirstName] wasn't entirely against you, it was clear you won't find support and help for the oppressed men from her. She is, after all, like the others. You'll just need to be more discreet in future with your nightly escapades in the male stock.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild14002;Something the train is good for, finally.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild14003;You knew [From.GetFirstName] would have forbidden to go to the stock again, but you couldn't imagine she could have had your love slaughtered by her huntresses! Now how could you go there again? Even if you found another one, she'd kill him to. Are you destined to live a loveless live?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild14003;It can't be!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild14004;Your [GetFromRelation] must have been fed up entirely with you if she didn't even react after being told you were found kissing a male in the livestock. This can only mean you're making a difference: others would have screamed, acted violently or hypocritically, but she was just speechless.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild14004;I'm making a difference!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild14005;You thought you had convinced [From.GetFirstName], but rumors still run she is keeping her unnatural sympathies for the males, as if she could change their position.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild14005;It's just a child's dream.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild14006;You had to have the male killed, such activities would have brought ruin upon you as well otherwise. Rigg does not tolerate males in her home. [From.GetFirstName] will get over it, eventually, and understand why was it right to do so.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild14006;And she'd better do it fast.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild14007;Probably your [GetFromRelation] is still going out at night, meeting her male friends. She will grow bored with their gruff charms and caresses soon enough.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild14007;Never too soon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild15;Why should you be trapped in this backwater savage society? You aspire for much more than hunting and fighting. There is a better world out there, you only need the courage to leave this broken life behind and start anew.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild15;And so I will!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild15001;This is unheard of! It was bad already to have that attitude, but now [From.GetFirstName] has disappeared! She escaped, leaving a message telling you she will never become an Amazon and has fled to a better world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild15001;It's her life after all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsamazonchild15001;This will NOT stand!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild15002;You were too quick and too smart for your jailers. You've left your home and the ruins with nobody catching you. You finally have a chance to do what you always wanted! Your whole life is ahead of you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild15002;Yes!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild15003;You barely reached the boundaries of your tribe's territory when two hunters jumped on you, dragging you back to your [GetFromRelation] in the darkness of night. She disciplined you once more, making it clear escaping will never be an option for you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild15003;I HATE YOU!!!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild15005;[From.GetFirstName] is too far now. She wanted so much to be free, let's hope at least she makes something good of it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild15005;Hm, I doubt that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild15006;She may be screaming and swearing eternal hate upon you, but [From.GetFirstName] is back. It wasn't hard to track her down. It's only a matter of time until she realize what her destiny really is and accepts it with gratitude.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild15006;As it is for all of us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild16;You've prepared your whole life for this day. It has come the time to test yourself, go alone in the jungle, prove your worth and be accepted by your tribe as a full-fledged Amazon. You feel confident in your abilities, you've been trained exactly for this, but you cannot hide a hint of fear alongside the anticipation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBsamazonchild16;You tried the best you could, despite all your limitations, and the time has come for the final test, to go alone in a hunt and return with a prize worthy of yourself. Then, if you've survived, you'll be an Amazon. You're scared and stressed and dearly hope to not be a shame for your family.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCCsamazonchild16;You couldn't believe they would try you anyway, after all you've said and done you thought you'd made pretty clear those traditions mean nothing to you. Yet, once again, you're forced against your will to go on a hunt, alone this time, and return with a prize worthy of you, so that you may be an Amazon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCDsamazonchild16;At this age an Amazon should go alone in the jungle and prove her worth, but you can't. You've missed your mark and will never become a fully fledged Amazonian huntress like all the other sisters.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild16;Time to go.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsamazonchild16;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild16001;By not being able to even partake in the final trial, your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] has brought shame on your family. As her mother, you are also sharing in this failure more than anybody else.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild16001;I have failed her and Amazonia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild16003;You tried your best, but the goddesses must have not been with you today. As the night comes, you return empty-handed to your village. You've shamed your family and denied yourself the chance to be a real Amazon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild16003;I'm a disgrace!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild16004;[From.GetFirstName] has failed in her rite of passage to become a true Amazon. As her mother, you share this shame forever, for her failings as a huntress are your failings as a teacher.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild16004;I am disgraced.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild17;You've passed the final trial! You return head-high to the village carrying your gruesome trophy and are welcomed by the cheers of your sisters. It is now time for you to follow the elders deep into the ruins of the great temple and perform the final rite which will turn you into a real Amazon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild17;I'm ready.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild17001;You enter the dark coven, the old Priestesses of Serena chanting on each side of the damp hall, and you shyly find your way to the sunken altar and kneel to give your respects to the Snake-Goddess and receive her blessing.\n It starts like nothing, you start feeling your clothes getting tighter as your frame grows wider and tougher. You get back on your feet, with a light head. All your worries are gone, it's all very simple: you're an Amazon, strong and deadly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild17001;Awesome!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild17002;You enter the dark coven, the old Priestesses of Serena chanting on each side of the damp hall, and you shyly find your way to the sunken altar and kneel to give your respects to the Snake-Goddess and receive her blessing.\n It's just a tickle on your skin and only seeing your reflection in the water makes you realize how pretty you've become. You get back on your feet, with a light head. All your worries are gone, it's all very simple: you're an Amazon, beautiful and deadly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild17002;Awesome!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild17003;You enter the dark coven, the old Priestesses of Serena chanting on each side of the damp hall, and you shyly find your way to the sunken altar and kneel to give your respects to the Snake-Goddess and receive her blessing.\n Something must be wrong, for the elders stop chanting, you realize it when you emerge from the pool smaller than you entered it. But you know soon enough this is no mistake: your body might have suffered, but you can see everything more clearly now, your dedication to Amazonia stronger than ever before.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild17003;Marvelous.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild17004;You enter the dark coven, the old Priestesses of Serena chanting on each side of the damp hall, and you shyly find your way to the sunken altar and kneel to give your respects to the Snake-Goddess and receive her blessing.\n Something must be wrong, for the elders stop chanting, you realize it when you emerge unchanged from the pool. But this is no mistake: you can feel unearthly energy flow through you and one of the shamans startles as she realizes and tells you the Goddess gave you her greatest gift.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild17004;Eternal youth..!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild17005;Your daughter [From.GetFirstName] passed her final trial and performed the rite to become a real Amazon. Your heart misses a beat when you see her emerge from the temple, strong and imposing like never before, a true testament to Amazonian superiority.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild17005;I'm proud of her!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild17006;Your daughter [From.GetFirstName] passed her final trial and performed the rite to become a real Amazon. Your heart misses a beat when you see her emerge from the temple, beautiful beyond compare, a true testament to Amazonian superiority.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild17006;I'm proud of her!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild17007;Your daughter [From.GetFirstName] passed her final trial and performed the rite to become a real Amazon. Your heart misses a beat when you see her emerge from the temple with the small body of a child, but the elders soon calm the crowd and yourself down, explaining how the goddess decided to give her a special more subtle gift.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild17007;I guess it's alright.. but still...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild17008;Your daughter [From.GetFirstName] passed her final trial and performed the rite to become a real Amazon. Your heart misses a beat when you see her emerge from the temple accompanied by the cheering of the elders themselves, chanting her as blessed by the Snake-Goddess with eternal youth!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild17008;I'm the mother of a demigoddess!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild17009;You enter the dark coven, the old Priestesses of Serena chanting on each side of the damp hall, and you shyly find your way to the sunken altar and kneel to give your respects to the Snake-Goddess and receive her blessing.\n Something must be wrong, for the elders stop chanting, you realize it when you emerge unchanged from the pool. But this is no mistake: you can feel unearthly energy flow through you and one of the shamans startles as she realizes and tells you the Goddess gave you the gift of magic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild17009;I'm a shaman?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild17010;Your daughter [From.GetFirstName] passed her final trial and performed the rite to become a real Amazon. Your heart misses a beat when you see her emerge from the temple surrounded by unearthly energies, as the elders announce the Goddess gave her magic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild17010;My little shaman!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild18;Amazonian society only barely tolerates men for their need as breeding stock, but still, a girl of your age starts to have needs. You've started to think perhaps you are searching in the wrong way. Maybe one of your training mates could fill the longing you feel...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild18;I'll ask her!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild18001;Amazonian society only barely tolerates men for their need as breeding stock, but still, a girl of your age starts to have needs. You've started to think perhaps you are searching in the wrong way. Your friend [From.GetFirstName] must think the same and has attempted some clumsy advances to you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild18001;Yes, this sounds like fun!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsamazonchild18001;You're really not my type, sorry.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild18002;You were so relieved to know [From.GetFirstName] shares your feeling for her. Now you can help each other and explore this new realm of possibilities without fearing the scorn of the goddesses.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild18002;It'll be fun!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild18003;You were saddened to hear [From.GetFirstName] reject your advances. Perhaps this is not the way either.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild18003;But.. what then?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAsamazonchild18004;It appears your daughter [From.GetFirstName] has found her happiness with another girl, [FromFrom.GetFirstName]. She has proved once more, a true Amazon doesn't really need men for anything but breeding.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAsamazonchild18004;I'm proud of her!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBsamazonchild18;It's not a good idea;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
