lizardman_sleepingslann;Sleeping Slann;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lizardman_sleepingslann_desc;To the Slann, time passes more quickly than it does for short-lived creatures, and Slann will regularly slip into extended periods of restful contemplation that might last decades, or even centuries, at a time. They sit unmoving on their stone palanquins or in their Star Chambers, and to an outsider a Slann might appear asleep, or even dead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

#
gor_rok;Gor-Rok;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
gor_rok_desc;When Gor-Rok first emerged from the spawning pool of Itza, his size, pure albino colourings and lone arrival immediately marked him as a future champion. And so it has been — for the Great White Lizard, as Gor-Rok is also known, has fought in countless battles, his heavily scarred body a testament to many thousands of hard-fought triumphs. Gor-Rok is the mightiest of warriors, the solid centre around which the Saurus battle lines advance, and the rock on which Itza’s enemies are broken.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAMEslizardmen8;Naggaront Ambush! ( Lizardmen );;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen8;Your long search for ancient artifacts on behalf of your superior has almost cost you your life today, when you've been attacked by a pack of young wild naggaronts, barely escaping along your entourage of Sauri.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVOPTAslizardmen8;All ssacrificess are worthy on behalf of the Old Onesss...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVOPTBslizardmen8;All ssacrificess are worthy on behalf of the Old Onesss...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen9;Old Ones preserve us,\n on our search, we've been caught by the wild beasts which are sacred to our progenitors, but still do not recognize our task in their mindless souls.\n My body has been temporarely incapacitated, but I shall soon retake my duties.\n\n The Old Ones are wise in their design;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen9;I sssee...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen10;Old Ones preserve us,\n on our search, we've been caught by the wild beasts which are sacred to our progenitors, but still do not recognize our task in their mindless souls.\n My body has been permanently incapacitated, and I may not be able to retake my current duties.\n\n The Old Ones are wise in their design;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen10;I sssee...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAMEslizardmen11;A Fragment is Found ( Lizardmen );;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen11;By the will of the Old Ones, your hard search has finally given its result: you've found a fragment of one of the ancient tablets of the Creators, whose translation will allow the Lizardmen to better fulfill their ultimate task.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen11;Praissse the Old Onesss!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen12;By the will of the Old Ones, your Chief Explorer has found a fragment of one of the ancient tablets of the Creators, whose translation will allow the Lizardmen to better fulfill their ultimate task.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen12;Praissse the Old Onesss!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen13;You've defeated the warriors of [From.GetName]. According to the old rituals, all of the prisoners caught fighting in this land are elegible to be worthy sacrifices to the Old Ones.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen13;Pillage all! Take everything!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCslizardmen13;We will take only the sacrifices.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBslizardmen13;These are not worthy, move on.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen14;[From.GetFirstName] has raided the province of [FromFrom.GetName], snatching many of the warriors and civilians and leaving nothing but a smoking rubble of many villages.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen14;Monstrous savages!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen15;[From.GetFirstName] has raided the province of [FromFrom.GetName], snatching many of the warriors and civilians and leaving nothing but a smoking rubble of many villages.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen15;Monstrous savages!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen16;[From.GetFirstName] has raided the province of [FromFrom.GetName]. Although most of the buildings are intact, there is only but a few survivors left to tell of the many screaming prisoners dragged away by [From.GetHerHis] warriors.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen16;Monstrous savages!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslizardmen17;You shamed the Creators: the tribute reaped from your enemies is not sufficient to perform a proper ceremony. Your miscalculation in this war is a clear sign you acted against the perfection of the Great Plan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBslizardmen17;The prisoners have been rounded up beneath the great temples of the Old Ones. Whom will you dedicate your sacrifice to?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen17;Imposssible!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBslizardmen17;The Great Sssun God Chotec.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCslizardmen17;The Benevolent Protector Quetzzl.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTDslizardmen17;The Myssteriousss Xholankha.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTEslizardmen17;The Ravenouss Sssotek!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen19;A Mage-Priest died under your care! This cannot be part of the Great Plan, your gross inefficency in the most holy of the tasks shows your being to be defective beyond measure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen19;No no no no no no no!!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen20;A Mage-Priest died under the care of one of your appointed chiefs! This cannot be part of the Great Plan, the gross inefficency of your helper in the most holy of the tasks shows your being also to be seriously defective.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen20;Sssshh.. How could it be!?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen21;The other Lizardmen do not understand your motives, they do not understand your behavior, so far it is removed from the Great Plan and the legacy of the Slann. It is common knowledge amongst the Skink that you emerged from your spawning pool somewhat defective.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen21;Nonsssensse!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen22;You boast about your personal accomplishments and crave for more glory at each step of the journey. Too close you associate yourself with what should be the design of the Old Ones.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen22;I am jussst overzealouss in my tasskss..!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen22001;You keep in your place and dulyfully perform your tasks. Truly, you are a productive and gregarious servant, working for the fruition of the Old Ones' Great Plan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen22001;I belong to the Creatorsss!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen22002;You keep missing work, underperforming, trying to constantly avoid responsibility. The Creators designed the Skinks to be loyal and productive servants, to behave as irresponsibly as you do is to go against your very nature.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen22002;Jussst a minute to ressst, no?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen22003;You work tirelessly and always crave for more tasks to be completed. Truly, you are a paragon of what it means to be a Skink: productive and efficient.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen22003;I work for the Great Plan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen22004;You are always quick to anger, ready to act violently against whatever presents to be an issue to yourself. Such a behavior could be forgivable in a Saurus, but a Skink is not made for violence and such outburst can only hint to some inherent deviance in your soul.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen22004;Well, ssscrew YOU!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen22005;You always keep a cooler blood than any of your peers and approach all your troubles with a calm and rational mind. Thus is what a Skink should be and you cannot fail to set a great example for all the younger spawns.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen22005;Good, good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen22006;A Skink should always act and speak openly to his spawn siblings. Your honesty and clarity can only quicken the achievement of the Great Plan through cohordinated effort.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen22006;Liess are uselesss in the face of the Old Onesss.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen22007;Your deceptive nature is a deviance and a frustration for all other Skinks around you. The Old Ones made you to cohoperate and work together, but your deceptions make you unreliable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen22007;It isss sstill for the greater good!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen22008;You like the glittering of gold and to keep such trinkets for yourself, but what does gold matter to the Ancients? Only lesser races, the savage mammals, should find any sort of solance by staring at a shiny useless metal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen22008;But.. but.. it'ss sssso pretty!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen22009;You find an unhealthy joy in giving away trinkets and resources to those around you, even though the legacy of the Old Ones is neither cheap not to be squandered.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen22009;Ssshould it be let to wassste?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen22010;You rarely know fear and gladly throw yourself in battle, this would be expected from a Saurus, but Skinks are made to be stewards and workers, not warriors. Your lack of fear might cloud your judgement and cause you to rush to a miscalculated action.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen22010;Doess it matter, if I win?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen22011;You trust in the Old Ones and spend all your waking thoughts on how to better serve them and quicken the achievement of the Great Plan. All Skinks look up to you as a paragon of zealotry.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen22011;The Old Ones are with us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen22012;Your lack of faith in the design of the Old Ones is abhorrent. Nothing should be more important than understanding and achieving the Great Plan, yet you often find yourself wasting thoughts on other frivolous matters.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen22012;There'sss more to thiss life than the Great Plan!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen23001;[From.GetTitledFirstName] agrees with your interpretation of the will of [FromFromFrom.GetTitledFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen23002;[From.GetTitledFirstName] disagrees with your interpretation: that's not what [FromFromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] meant!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen24;The clerks rush into your hall, screaming in discomfort: [From.GetTitledFirstName] has shifted his head's position in his sleep! What does it MEAN!?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen24;He wantsss a ritual to be performed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBslizardmen24;He'sss warning usss of a coming threat!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCslizardmen24;He wantsss to be moved to a better place!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTDslizardmen24;He wantsss hiss neck cleaned!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen24001;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has found out [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] has shifted his head's position in his sleep and concluded the Slann his silently demanding a ritual to be held in the honor of the Old Ones.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen24001;Yesss, that's sssurely it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBslizardmen24001;No, no, that'ss not what he meant!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTOPTAslizardmen24002;Yesss, that's sssurely it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBslizardmen24002;No, no, that'ss not what he meant!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen24003;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has found out [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] has shifted his head's position in his sleep and concluded the Slann his silently demanding to be moved to a better location.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen24003;Yesss, that's sssurely it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBslizardmen24003;No, no, that'ss not what he meant!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen24004;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has found out [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] has shifted his head's position in his sleep and concluded the Slann his silently requesting his neck to be cleaned.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen24004;Yesss, that's sssurely it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBslizardmen24004;No, no, that'ss not what he meant!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen25;It has been nearly a moon cycle since a swat of flies has been lingering over [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s head, drawing strange forms in the air. Many are know wondering what is the meaning of these flies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen25;They're mimicking a constellation we sshould look for!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBslizardmen25;They're sshowing the flow of magic around him!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCslizardmen25;He called them to ussse ass magic component!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTDslizardmen25;They're ssucking hiss sweat! Ssshoo them!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen25001;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has determined the meaning behind some flies swarming over [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName]'s head must be linked to one of the sacred constellations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen25001;Yesss, that's sssurely it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBslizardmen25001;No, no, that'ss not what he meant!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen25002;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has determined the flies swarming over [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName]'s head must be following the Winds of Magic flowing around the sleeping Slann.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen25002;Yesss, that's sssurely it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBslizardmen25002;No, no, that'ss not what he meant!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen25003;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has determined the flies swarming over [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName]'s head must have been summoned there by the Slann for a later use as spell components.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen25003;Yesss, that's sssurely it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBslizardmen25003;No, no, that'ss not what he meant!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen25004;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has determined the flies swarming over [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName]'s head are an annoyance sent by the Ruinous Powers and must be eliminated.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen25004;Yesss, that's sssurely it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBslizardmen25004;No, no, that'ss not what he meant!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen26;The clerks rush into your hall, screaming in discomfort: [From.GetTitledFirstName] has just started snoring! What does it MEAN!?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen26;It's a prophecy in the tongue of the Old Onesss!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBslizardmen26;He'sss casting a very complicate sspell!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCslizardmen26;The light isss bothering him!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTDslizardmen26;He'sss asking for food!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen26001;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has determined [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName]'s alledged snoring is in fact a prophecy in a long-forgotteng language.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen26001;Yesss, that's sssurely it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBslizardmen26001;No, no, that'ss not what he meant!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen26002;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has determined [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName]'s alledged snoring is complex and obscure spell being casted by the collective Slann.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen26002;Yesss, that's sssurely it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBslizardmen26002;No, no, that'ss not what he meant!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen26003;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has determined [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName]'s snoring is due to the Slann being bothered by a source of light distracting him from his meditation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen26003;Yesss, that's sssurely it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBslizardmen26003;No, no, that'ss not what he meant!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen26004;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has determined [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName]'s snoring is due to the Slann being hungry.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen26004;Yesss, that's sssurely it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBslizardmen26004;No, no, that'ss not what he meant!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen27;You could barely breathe after receiving the sensational news: [From.GetTitledFirstName] just spoke to one of the priests! And he asked for a maggot soup! What does it MEAN!?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen27;It'sss a metaphor for ssomething to come!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBslizardmen27;He demands a sssacrifice be made in hiss name!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCslizardmen27;Hiss ssskin is dry! Wassh him!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTDslizardmen27;He wantss to eat ssome maggot ssoup!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen27001;[FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] just spoke, asking for a maggot soup. [From.GetTitledFirstName] has determined his words are a methaphor for some obscure future event.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen27001;Yesss, that's sssurely it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBslizardmen27001;No, no, that'ss not what he meant!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen27002;[FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] just spoke, asking for a maggot soup. [From.GetTitledFirstName] has determined he is demanding a sacrifice to be made in his honor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTTITLEslizardmen29;The Ancient Tablet;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen29;[From.GetTitledFirstName] awoke for a minute to make clear the will of the Old Ones: the location of one of the ancient artifacts of the time before the fall of the Polar Gates has been found. Even now the foul agents of strife are working to cloud the vision of the Mage-Priest and snatch away this sacred relic. Its recovery would be invaluable to further the understanding of the Great Plan, you are therefore charged to lead an expedition in this foreign land and clear the way for the Skink archeologists.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen29;Mobilize our armiesss immediately!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTTITLEslizardmen29001;The Lizardmen;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen29001;Foul news from afar: it appears a great alien fleet is sailing towards your realm, charged with coldblooded monsters. \n The mysterious lizard people of the far west have left their resting places for your realm. There is no telling why or when they will arrive, but it is clear their intentions are not peaceful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen29001;We must prepare to meet them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTTITLEslizardmen29002;The Ancient Tablet;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen29002;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has sent out messengers in the name of [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName], to inform all Skink Priests it is the will of the Mage-Priests to focus their efforts on the recovery of an ancient tablet of the Old Ones, divined into a faraway realm of savages. \n\n As a devout follower of the Old Ones, it is your duty to join the efforts of your spawn siblings.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen29002;Mobilize our armiesss immediately!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBslizardmen29002;It might resssult in a missscalculation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen31005;Since the start of the war, [From.GetTitledFirstName] has appeared restless in his sleep. Many Skinks agree this is a clear sign the Slann disapproves of this war and wishes it to be ended immediately.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen31005;Asss the Old Oness command!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBslizardmen31005;It could be sssomething elssse...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen32005;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has awaken! He has determined the victory in this war is essential to the ultimate achievement of the Great Plan and has decided to take the lead himself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen32005;I bow before you, Great One.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen33005;You've done what you could to forward the Great Plan and the interests of the Old Ones in this world. Now the war is over and it is time for you to resume your duties and focus your attention in preventing Chaos from consuming all Earth. You're confident the Skinks will fill in your absence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen33005;Hnnnfffhhh...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen34001;[From.GetTitledFirstName] did not wake at the first attempt. Trying again so soon would be sacrilegious.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen34001;I missscalculated!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTFslizardmen17;The Great Huntress Rigg!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTGslizardmen17;All the Great Old Ones!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTIslizardmen17;Kukaili, the Great Devourer!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen35;[Root.PlotTarget.GetTitledName] drinks much more ripplejuice than a Skink should. It clouds his vision and makes him more likely to miscalculate and less productive in his tasks. The Skinks must be informed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen35;I will at once!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen35001;[From.GetFirstName] has discovered [From.PlotTarget.GetTitledName] drinks much more ripplejuice than a Skink should.

EVTOPTAslizardmen20101;SsssshhhaaaaAAAAHH!!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen43;You Sentinels have found out a group of miyan hunters roaming about near one of your sacred sites. It was only through the grace of the Ancients these ravenous creatures didn't eat one of the sacred artifacts before being apprehended.\n The foul-smelling mammals squeak in some barbarous language, trying to plead for their useless lives, most likely.\n The Sauri are ready to make short work of the plump robbers and await your command.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen43;Sssave their nossess though! They bring good luck.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBslizardmen43;They're sso fat. We'll have roassted meat for a month!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCslizardmen43;Kill them and take whatever little posssessions they have.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen44;A wild Amazon has been captured inside your demesne.

EVTOPTAslizardmen44;I sssmell Creator'ss relics insside her! Tear her OPEN!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBslizardmen44;How amussing! Put it in our recreational zoo.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCslizardmen44;Kill her and repurpose her belongingsss.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen44101;You're a shame for your family, unworthy of the title of Amazon. Your [GetFromRelation] has decreed you're enceforth banished from Amazonia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen44101;What!?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen44001;You finally met your end against a worthy opponent. If nothing less, it's a good death.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen44001;...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen44002;You've received news your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] died in a fierce fight against a creature of the dark. If nothing else, at least in death she has redeemed herself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen44002;Good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen44003;You finally met your end. It wasn't even a good one.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen44003;...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen44004;You've received news your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] died in an accident of some sort. It seems that even in death she was a disappointment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen44004;I will soon forget about her.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen44005;You really can't remember what was all the deal about female supremacy. Here people are much nicer to you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen44005;Yep!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen44006;You would have thought [From.GetFirstName] could at least die with honor, but the news you've heard tell much worst. She somehow settled with men of a foreign land, becoming a tamed and fat cow, content to be led about by some male.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen44006;Disgusting.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen44007;You redeemed yourself in your exile.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen44007;Yes!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen44008;Your edict may have brought some good after all: [From.GetFirstName] has returned to you, showered in glory, carring trophies of powerful beasts as gifts, and telling of her grand exploits in exile. She submits to your mercy, asking to receive another chance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen44008;Rise again, as my [GetFromRelation] once more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBslizardmen44008;You can live here, but as a newborn Amazon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen45;[Root.GetFirstName]\n My Amazons will no longer suffer the rule of a weak and decadent Queen.\n We demand you relinquish your crown at once or prepare to test your mettle in battle once more. \n\n And may the Old Gods see the truth in it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen45;I will stand down.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBslizardmen45;You'll have to take my crown from my cold dead hands!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen46;[Root.GetFirstName]\n I will not suffer this treasonous act against me. \n\n We shall see how complacent I really am.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen46;Indeed we shall! To arms!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen47;[Root.GetFirstName]\n I do not wish for conflict between us. I therefore relinquish my rule over this realm.\n\n[From.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTOPTAslizardmen49;May the next Queen be stronger.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen50;Palace life is not so bad. You can have all the pet consorts you desire and live a peaceful and easy life, without tainting yourself with brute violence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAlizardmen50;This is the life...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen51;[From.GetFirstName] has grown lazy and complacent in her easy life, grievously staining your family's reputation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen51;Hm...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen52001;In such a dangerous and violent world, you're lucky to be born a noble Amazon. Beautiful, free and rich, with servants for your every need. What else can a woman ask for?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen52001;Hmhmm...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen52002;The jungle is a scary place, filled with poisonous plants, dangerous predators and vicious lizardmen, all too ready to sacrifice any trespasser to their bloodthirsty gods. Is it so strange for a person to extert caution in this world?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen52002;No it's not!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen52003;The elders might teach that males are nothing but cattle to be used to produce more Amazons, but how can you resist the lure of a strong man holding you? To be with another and join is such a unique experience...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen52003;They're not so bad.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen52004;There are many perks in the palace life, your favourite is to take the first choice of any game the huntresses have managed to hunt during the day. So many good exotic things to try out, the sweetest wine in the realm, strange new spices...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen52004;Oh! What's this one?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen52005;Going out to hunt is such a chore. After all, what are huntresses made for? A well-bred Amazon like you should not trouble herself with such lowly work.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen52005;Right so...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen52006;Nothing scares you. Against every foe, any obstacle, your mind is steady and your heart jumps at the chance of a new adventure. You truly incarnate the ideals of Amazon lifestyle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen52006;Yes!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen52007;You're not an hypocrite like all those others, preaching on how they despise males, but then running into the arms of their consorts. You are one of the few to experience love in its purest form: with another woman.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen52007;And the sweetest kind of all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen53001;You might have been excessive with the bloodwine. Last thing you remember before awakening in the mud is giggling naked on the roof of the palace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen53001;Hnnn... My head!..;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen53002;On prospect, you might have wanted to go easy on the roasted Naggaront. After a few gurgling noises from your stomach, you rush to puke on the side of a tree.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen53002;Bleah!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen53003;Some of the herbs you tasted were not at all to your liking, for you soon find yourself asking for water, with your face red and a chorus of laughter accompanying your stumbling to the fountain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen53003;Aaahhh!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen53004;One of the concoctions you drank tonight put you in contact with the spirits. You can feel them around you and speak their words to your sisters.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen53004;Heed me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen54001;[From.GetFirstName] sits brazenly on the other side of the fire, calling the attention of the sisters nearby and challenging to a drinking contest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen54001;You're on!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBslizardmen54001;I don't feel like drinking tonight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen54002;You tried to push [From.GetFirstName] into a drink contest, but she did not felt up to it. By all accounts, victory is yours, although it is not a satisfactory one.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen54002;It'll do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen54003;[From.GetFirstName] has accepted your challenge for a drinking contest. A few of the other sisters come around the fire to look as you clash the first jug with hers and take the first long sip.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen54003;Now you drink!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen54004;With an absentminded look and a sallow face, [From.GetFirstName] shakes her head, admitting defeat. You laugh in triumph as the sisters rise you up and give pats on your back.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen54004;Sshtop spinning!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen54005;[From.GetFirstName] holds her jug near her face, falters, and shakes her head. You laugh in triumph as the sisters rise you up and give pats on your back.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen54005;Sshtop spinning!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslizardmen54006;[From.GetFirstName] tosses her jug on the sand, waiting for you to take your drink. Your head feels still pretty clear, you should have this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBslizardmen54006;[From.GetFirstName] tosses her jug on the sand, waiting for you to take your drink. Thinks are starting to get foggy and, as you reach for your jug, you find yourself snickering for no reason, but you should still be able to take another, shouldn't you?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCCslizardmen54006;[From.GetFirstName] tosses her jug on the sand, waiting for you to take your drink. At least, that must be the case, you can't really see very well. You wait the right time between hiccups and prepare to drink again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCDslizardmen54006;[From.GetFirstName] is just a blurry image before you, across the campfire, but she's still up, which means it must be your turn. You try a few times to get a hold on the drink, until one of the sisters jams it into your hand, and prepare to have at it again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen54006;Jug!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBslizardmen54006;E-Ennough!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen54007;You try to hold the jug and take another sip, but your body cannot take any further and you collapss on the ground with an empty expression.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen54007;...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen55001;It started just with a little handful taken here and there from the dishes, but it is now becoming clear  you and [From.GetFirstName] are quickly escalating into an open competition for the better courses.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen55001;I'll show you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBslizardmen55001;Here, take it. I think I've had enough for tonight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen55002;It started just with a little handful taken here and there from the dishes, but the moment you started to be more competitive about it [From.GetFirstName] was quick to cower away, leaving you full domain over the main courses.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen55002;Ah! That'll teach her.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen55003;You drag [From.GetFirstName]'s dish towards your side of the campfire, taking mouthfuls out the course as she looks in anger. It started just with a little handful taken here and there from the dishes, but it has become clear you and [From.GetFirstName] are quickly escalating into an open competition for the better courses.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen55003;Hmmplfh!..;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen55004;[From.GetFirstName] puts a hand before her mouth, trying to shake her hand and dragging herself away from the food in disgust, thus declaring you victorious.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen55004;Yeah! Crawl away!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen55005;[From.GetFirstName] rolls on the side, holding her swollen belly and letting out a painful groan with her mouth still full of half-chewed food. It appears you've prevailed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen55005;What's wrong? Having some trouble standing?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslizardmen55006;[From.GetFirstName] steals one of your dishes, and starts to eat ravenously. In response, you take one of hers, chewing as fast as you can and looking for more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBslizardmen55006;[From.GetFirstName] still keeps eating. You look around for the next course to snatch from the cheering sisters nearby and almost puke, but it's still not too bad. You probably can take a few more courses...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCCslizardmen55006;You look down, tapping at your swollen belly as you try to get in another bite. [From.GetFirstName] is still eating, so, unless you want to admit defeat, you must keep going.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCDslizardmen55006;You gurgle, trying to hold in the last bite and take a look at your opponent, confirming she's still chewing another piece of roasted meat, before going back at your course. Probably you can take it for a little longer...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen55006;I... can go... on!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBslizardmen55006;Hmmmpfh... enough!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen55007;You roll on the sand, holding your swollen belly, incapable of eating one single bite more. You pray the gods to throw up soon while rolling exhausted on your side.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen55007;*Blrgh*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen56001;In the frenzy of the ritual celebrations, you've bumped laughing into [From.GetFirstName]. Although you didn't mean anything by it, she seemed to take it as a direct challenge and answered pushing you violently on the ground.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen56001;NOW it's on!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBslizardmen56001;Alright, just... calm down!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen56002;[From.GetFirstName] just ran into you. You pushed her back, hoping for a fight, but she's too cowardly or drunk to respond and you soon lose interest in her.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen56002;Bah, look where you go next time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen56102;[From.GetFirstName] just ran into you. You pushed her back, hoping for a fight, and she seems very eager to enable you. Throwing herself right back at you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen56102;Come here!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen56004;The two of you fight off nearby the campfire, trying to get a hold on each other, hitting and breaking off.\n Soon, other sisters gather around, cheering for one or the other, as your fight grows more violent, bolstered by the screams of the other Amazons, inhebriated by the festivities in honor of the Snake-Goddess. \n You throw yourselves at each other, roll in the mud, grapple and punch at every opening.\n Finally, you manage to take a hold of your opponent from the back and squeeze, keeping her tight until she screams defeat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen56004;YAAHH!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen56005;The two of you fight off nearby the campfire, trying to get a hold on each other, hitting and breaking off.\n Soon, other sisters gather around, cheering for one or the other, as your fight grows more violent, bolstered by the screams of the other Amazons, inhebriated by the festivities in honor of the Snake-Goddess. \n You throw yourselves at each other, roll in the mud, grapple and punch at every opening.\n Finally, your opponent manages to take a hold of you from the back and squeezes, keeping you tight until you're forced to yield.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen56005;Hhhnnng! Enough!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen53005;The climax of the celebration has passed from a few hours and now you find yourself tired and happy, wrapped around your sisters, near the campfire. As you say sweet things to each other in your drunken stupor, you feel quite happy to be in such a company.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen53005;I love you guys!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen53006;Under the beating of the drums you fret and dance, alongside your sisters, screaming on the top of your lungs praises for Serena and the other Old Gods, hoping your celebration will bring their favour upon your tribe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen53006;Hear us, almighty Creators!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen53007;As the celebration reaches its climax, inhebriated by the mystic fumes of the shamans and driven into a near-frenzy by your dancing, you run around the campfire, screaming louder to make the gods notice you. \n The Elders finally carry forth the sacred snakes for the rituals to Serena, and the scaley creatures are set free amongst you.\n At first, you jump near them, teasing their bite and retreating just before they strike, then you come slower, with little offerings to endear them to you and lay down, letting them embrace and protect you as Rigg protects Amazonia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen53007;Dance with us...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTHslizardmen17;Sacrifice some, but keep the best for my harem!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen60;Your huntresses have captured an interesting speciment from your last raid. What should be done with him?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCslizardmen60;I'll keep him for my collection.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBslizardmen60;He will be sacrificed soon enough.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen61;You've sent your couriers to spread the word as quick as possible: you will organize a great tournament within the great ruins so that you and your sisters may revel in the excitement of violence and the gods may take your sweat and blood as tribute and look down upon you with favour.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen61;Rigg be praised!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen61001;Fellow Sister!\n I call upon you to shed blood in name of Rigg! Let the Great Huntress be pleased as all of the daughters of Serana fight for her favour in the great ruins!\n\n We await you.\n [From.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen61001;About time!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBslizardmen61001;I think I'll pass this time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen61002;Rigg be praised!\n I will join you in the great ruins, sister and prove my worth for all of the Amazons to see!\n\n[From.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen61002;Good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen61003;Sorry, fellow sister,\n but I send this message to inform you I will not be able to take part in your great ritual this season.\n\n May Rigg forgive me.\n [From.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen61003;Bah!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslizardmen62;All the able-bodied Amazons in your realm have gathered in the great ruins for the brawling tournament you've organized in honor of Rigg. Not only nobleblood to participate, but many huntresses, eager to meet the best amongst the daughters of Serena and learn by watching them fight under the eyes of the goddesses.\n All your sisters flock over the old stone steps half-eaten by the jungle, looking down in the arena in anticipation.\n Above them, the fallen statues of the Creators look down with blind eyes. As the legend goes, only when enough blood will be shed in the sand of the arena, the great statue of Rigg will come to life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBslizardmen62;Not enough Amazons came at your call. The great ruins lie empty before you, with just some curious huntresses roaming around. You've waited for a few days now and it is certain no one else will come.\n It is with great regret that you announce you are forced to cancel the tournament.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen62;And so let the blood start spilling!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBslizardmen62;This was a waste of time…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen62001;All the able-bodied Amazons in your realm have gathered in the great ruins for the brawling tournament [From.GetTitledFirstName] organized in honor of Rigg.

EVTOPTAslizardmen62001;Let's start this already!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen62002;As the ruling Queen of your realm, it is only right for you to be the first to fight, to honor Rigg and lead your sisters by example.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen62002;I will be an exemplar winner.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen62003;It is your turn to fight for the glory of Rigg and yourself. You walk towards the centre of the arena, accompanied by the cheering of your sisters sitting and hanging from the ruins around you. [From.GetFirstName], your adversary, comes from the opposite side to meet you in the middle. You bump into each other's chest and prepare yourself for the starting drum.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen62003;Bring it on!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESCslizardmen62005;[From.GetFirstName] was sad to announce that, due to lack of participants, the tournament will be cancelled.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESCCslizardmen63001;You try several feigns, but when [From.GetFirstName] finally seems to be falling for it, it turns out to be a feign on her part.

EVTOPTAslizardmen65001;I'll go hunting, I think.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslizardmen65002;This tournament has been a great test of your skills. Between the training and the strain of the challenges themselves, you feel stronger than you've ever been.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen65002;I could lift a tree!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTOPTAslizardmen65003;Rigg's touch!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslizardmen65004;You were just about to leave the stadium with your sisters after the final feast for your victory, when you received a mystical vision: the Huntress, stalking her scaled preys in the shadow skies over the ruined temple.

EVTOPTAslizardmen65004;And I am worthy of this blessing!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCGslizardmen63001;You're the first to draw blood, slashing a light wound on [From.GetFirstName]'s arm.

EVTDESCIslizardmen63001;You attack first, but your strike ends in the sand as [From.GetFirstName] slips on the side and waves her spear lower, aiming for your legs.

EVTDESCslizardmen52008;An Amazon should be strong and inspire her sisters with her figure, what huntress could follow a weak leader? Your body is so frail, what does it matter if the will behind it is strong? It won't protect you if a Naggaront mauls you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen52008;The body is not all…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen52009;When your sisters call you a strong leader, they're not speaking metaphorically: you are an example of how an Amazon Queen should be, with muscles of steel, chiseled on your arms and chest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen52009;Just look at this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen52010;You've been educated to always appease and accomodate, to always try and talk before fighting. What Amazon could respect such a spineless leader? An Amazon should not care about words, she should meet any opposition with the tip of her spear.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen52010;Wait, come on, let's talk about this!..;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen52011;You're a woman of few words, you prefer to let your actions speak for you. And it is well often for your actions to be violent in nature. This is the sort of Queen the Huntresses can respect, the one who fights with them and wastes no time in small talk and appeasement.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen52011;Rightly so!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen52012;When was the last time you went out to hunt alongside your sisters? Instead, you waste your days gorging on their game, growing fat and complacent on your throne. What sort of proud Warrior-Queen are you?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen52012;The body is not all…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen52013;You lead Amazons, yet you yourself are by many considered just a freak. You were born wrong, they said, and rightly so. With such a deformed body, how can you be expected to defend your realm and fight with your sisters?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen52013;It's not MY fault!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen61900;It's been a long journey, but you're finally back home. A great festival to honor Rigg can only be organized every so often, it'll be at least five solar rotations before another one may be issued.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen61900;I had a good time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslizardmen70;It is only a question of reading correctly the right table to understand the location of the old Temple of Rejuvenation. It is an important part of the Legacy of the Ancients and must be recovered and preserved. It is undoubtedly part of the Great Plan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBslizardmen70;Since childhood, you heard stories of the fabled philter of eternal life, gifted by the goddesses to their best huntresses. Now you have your chance to finde the ancient pool and bathe into it, as the legend goes, re-emerging strong and young forever.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCCslizardmen70;This will be a long and perilous voyage, but the prize will be well worth all the trouble.\n You will venture in the unknown jungles of Lustria, one of the most inhospitable places in the world, and return with the fabled philter of eternal youth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen70;Time to go!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslizardmen71;You were swimming deep through one of the narrow rivers choked by tne intricate flora of the jungle when you catch a series of small shadows moving the waters not too far from where you are. The savages' ambush might have been ruined, but you must fight through them to get to your destination.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBslizardmen71;You were sailing across one of the narrow rivers choked by the intricate flora of the jungle when one of your sisters is struck down by a poisonous dart. You immediately recognize it as a miyan ambush and shout to the other Amazons to shield themselves immediately.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCCslizardmen71;You were sailing across one of the narrow rivers choked by the intricate flora of the Lustrian jungle, when one of your guards falls from the side of your boat, with his back covered with needles. A shrieking pack of bloated miyans emerges from the trees on both sides, starting to shoot more of the poisonous darts on your group.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBslizardmen71;Wait! We don't want trouble!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen71;Attack!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslizardmen71001;You hiss the order of attack to the Sauri and await in the depths of the river as the warriors emerge and maul meticulously the unwary mammals before they can react. The water has turned red and thick with blood once the Sauri swim back to you giving the all-clear.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBslizardmen71001;Your arrows and spears soon find their place in the numb skulls of the miyans, killing and scaring the little men away without significant losses for your group.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCCslizardmen71001;Your men fire at the vile savages for some time, quickly forcing them to retreat behind the trees. You continue to shoot until you've passed the ambush point for a while, making sure the little pests are not following you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen71001;We keep moving.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBslizardmen71001;Perhaps it's time to abandon this quest…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslizardmen71002;You hiss the order of attack to the Sauri and await in the depths of the river as the warriors emerge and maul meticulously the unwary mammals from below. Even then, the litte creatures manage to toss some spears and shoot some darts back, killing a Saurus and even managing to reach you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBslizardmen71002;Your arrows and spears soon find their place in the numb skulls of the miyans, killing and scaring the little men away. Even so, you lose another sister and are wounded yourself before finally winning the day.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCCslizardmen71002;Your men fire at the vile savages for some time, but suffer several losses before finally managing to force them to retreat. You continue to shoot until you've passed the ambush point and only then realize you've been wounded by the little creeps as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen71002;Grmphf!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBslizardmen71002;Perhaps it's time to abandon this quest…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslizardmen71003;You hiss the order of attack to the Sauri and await in the depths of the river as the warriors swim towards the mammals, but the creatures manage to see the coming attackers and react with uncanny speed. The Sauri are struck through the head by their spears and a storm of poisonous darts falls upon you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBslizardmen71003;One after the other, your Amazons fall to the poisonous darts of the miyans. Some do not even manage to take any of them before falling, an ignominous death. You are among the last, keeping on fighting until the poison takes away your last strengths.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCCslizardmen71003;Your men fire at the vile savages for some time, but suffer several losses and are finally overcome by the miyans. You're riddled with poisonous darts as you try to leave the boat and fall head-first into the water, slowly sinking.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen71003;Ghhhh!..;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslizardmen71004;Speaking in their dialect and explaining your quest, you manage to calm down the miyans. They've dealt with Amazons before and, although it was not always a peaceful experience, they agree to let you and your sisters pass through their territory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen71004;Hard to believe half-males would be so reasonable…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslizardmen71005;You've tried to explain you and your sisters mean no harm to the miyans and only desire to travel on, but their chief appears to have had already unpleasant experiences with other Amazons and screams to resume the attack.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen71005;Fine! You brought this on yourself!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslizardmen72;It looks like another coming storm at first, but as the thundering noise grows stronger, you realize it's much worse: the trees in front of you shake violently and are eradicated as a pack of crazed stegadonts rampages through.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESCAslizardmen73;You were crossing a barren canyon, filled with the poisonous stench of a yellow-snatcher, when you finally catch the feeble scent of other Lizardmen. You emit a high-pitched hiss, and the ambushers come out, weapons still at hand.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBslizardmen73;You were crossing a barren canyon, filled with the poisonous stench of a yellow-snatcher, when you finally realize one of your sisters has gone missing. You call the others to alert and catch the shimmering of scales from above you. It's the Lizardmen!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTOPTAslizardmen73;There'sss no need for violence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBslizardmen73;Attack!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslizardmen73001;You've stained yourself with the blood of fellow Lizardmen. It is impossible to say how their loss may impact or slow down the achievement of the Great Plan. This is not a good day.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBslizardmen73001;The Lizardmen have a good vantage point, but you and your sisters have better aiming skills. You keep firing arrows as you run across the canyon, finally reaching a shielded point and carefully proceeding from there.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESCBslizardmen73002;The Lizardmen have a good vantage point, but you and your sisters have better aiming skills. You keep firing arrows as you run across the canyon, but there's no safe point in sight and you end losing several good sisters before leaving the battle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESCBslizardmen73003;You thought your aiming skills would have been enough to counteract the Lizardmen's highter ground, but it was to no avail. The poisonous field slows you and before you know it, a spear falls into your back, pinning you on the ground.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCCslizardmen73003;You hoped to scare the creatures away with your superior firepower, but the Lizardmen are resilient and the poisonous flowers slow your men's reflexes. They fall one after the other and in the end your turn comes as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen73003;…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslizardmen73004;A Saurus was leading the pack of Lizardmen on the slope of the canyon, while he was quick to action, he was also very receptive when he recognized you as a Skink Chief and carefully listened to your words before hissing to his warriors to stand down and let you pass.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESCAslizardmen73005;A Saurus was leading the pack of Lizardmen on the slope of the canyon, they are made to be quick to anger and violence and it turns out to be impossible to catch his attention to speak with him now that he's in a frenzy. You will have to fight them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen73005;Hmmssssshhh…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslizardmen75;You've spent years scouring the deadly jungles of Lustria, but still no trace of the fabled Fountain of Youth. Your funds for this expedition have been depleted. Perhaps it is time to renounce to this foolish quest and return to your home, before dying or being driven insane by your obsession?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen75;No! I've enough resources to found another expedition!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBslizardmen75;I have neither money nor strength to continue.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslizardmen74;This might finally be it. The old ruins lay before you, buried under layers upon layers of jungle plants, but the glyphs leave no doubt about it: this is the place you're looking for.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen74;Check for traps.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBslizardmen74;Let's move!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslizardmen74001;Three of your group fall into a pit trap right as they walk on the final staircase. Luckily, you are alright.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen74001;Forward!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslizardmen74002;Three of your group fall into a spiked pit trap right as they walk on the final staircase. One of them almost drags you to the same end, but you manage to hold onto the edge and survive, albeit wounded.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen74002;Forward!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslizardmen74003;The portal to the inner temple is so close, but in your rush, you are doomed: a pitfall opens under your feet and you fall screaming alongside your warriors to a spikey death.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen74003;AaaaaAAAAHHH!!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslizardmen74004;You were right to check for traps. There are several levers and false steps to be disabled or avoided altogether. You manage to get safely across the final staircase and cross the main portal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen74004;Finally!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslizardmen76;The dark hallways are covered in ancient glyphs, long-consumed by dampness and mould. And yet, you can still make out some of the prophecies written upon them. This is the place where your quest will end. You know there will be a guardian and when the Coatl floats down, wrapping his coils on the columns between you and the final room and spitting words of warning, you are ready to bow down before him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBslizardmen76;The dark hallways are covered in ancient glyphs, long-consumed by dampness and mould. They are the tongue of the Ancients, whose understanding has been long-forgotten by the Amazons. Yet you know your close and you feel the traps could not have been your final test.\n It is then that the Coatl floats down from the ceiling, hissing and wrapping his coils along the columns of the main corridor to block your way. He might threatening you in the ancient tongue, but it's hard for you to understand.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCCslizardmen76;The dark hallways are covered in ancient glyphs, long-consumed by dampness and mould. Not that you could understand them in any case.\n You're focused on the faint light coming from the end of the main corridor, you know that's your final destination, you can almost hear the sound of the water. \n None of your group realizes the danger untile the massive feathered snake floats from above, spitting poison and fire upon you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen76;Guardian of the Old Ones, hear my plea!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBslizardmen76;*Try to speak in the ancient tongue*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCslizardmen76;We must attack!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslizardmen77;"The Coatl stares deeply into your soul, hissing slowly.\n ""You have been created to accomplish this task. But such is not the task you believed to be fighting for when you left your pool. You will be thus allowed to enter the source of Rejuvenation, so that you may serve the Creators in your ultimate goal, but you shall never mention of this place, nor bring anything with you. Such is the will of the Ancients.""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBslizardmen77;"The Coatl stares deeply into your soul, hissing slowly.\n ""You were not created to accomplish this task, yet you are here. It is not the will of the Ancients for you to drink from this well, nor to share its knowledge with your siblings. You were wrong by coming here, yet the Ancients still have a place for you in your grand design. Return from whence you came, forget about this place and accomplish their true will.""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen77;I am humbled and ready to do the will of the godsss.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBslizardmen77;This *mussst* be my task! Ssstand aside!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCslizardmen77;I recoil at your wordsss, o mighty one.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslizardmen77001;It took a messenger of the Old Gods themselves to let you understand the error of your ways, but you understand now this quest was never yours to take. You will return home, to your predesigned duties.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen77001;Yesss…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslizardmen78;It is difficult to pronounce the proper words and even more difficult to understand the answer of the Coatl. There is no doubt he is angered about something and, after a few repetitions, it is clear what is the general meaning of his answer: you are not meant to be in this place, you've angered the gods and, unless you flee immediately, he shall crush and swallow you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen78;(Lie) Let me offer myself as compensation for the offense!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBslizardmen78;Not if I kill you first!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCslizardmen78;I will do as the Ancients command…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslizardmen78001;The Coatl is initially surprised by your offering, but his tone turns pleased soon enough. You lay on the ground, tossing aside your spear and ordering to your sisters to stand back, and call for the great snake to take the offering again.\n The Coatl slithers towards you, opening his jaws, and with a slow movement of his neck starts swallowing you.\n You hold your breath and await until you're completely inside the creature, then free your dagger and violently stab the creature's head from the inside.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen78001;Die!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslizardmen78002;The Coatl shakes his head at the first stab, but, before you can cut deeper, drowns you in a flow of fire and poison, ending your little deception in a swift swallow.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen78002;…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslizardmen78003;The Coatl shakes his head, trying to spit you out, but you stab deeper, piercing his skull and cutting into his brain again and again. The body of the creature twists and whirls as your sisters start to attack it as well, until it finally crumbles into the ground and you emerge from it, covered in spit and blood.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen78003;AAAHH!!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslizardmen79;The great snake whirls his coils around the entire corridors, whipping and spitting and lunging with his fangs, killing a warrior with each strike.\n You strike it again and again, cutting through his scales at dozens of points, but the blades and spears can barely draw blood.\n At every burst of fire, your forces dwindle, if you do not kill the guardian soon, you will not survive.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen79;Kill him! Kill him!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslizardmen79001;The guardian was too strong for your tired forces. With a final swoop, the Coatl burns the remaining warriors and crushes you under his deadly coils.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen79001;Arrghh…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslizardmen79002;Bleeding from a thousand cuts, the great snake finally falls, defeated. You stand over his carcass, cutting away his head and proceed further. None of your warriors survived, but that doesn't matter anymore…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen79002;I'm so close…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslizardmen80;There it is, not like you expected, actually. It's not a fountain at all, more like a pool, shimmering with unearthly light, water boiling but exhaling no warmth you can perceive. You slowly and carefully enter, one foot at a time, bending over the surface to take a deep sip.\n The liquid has no flavor, but as it runs through your body, you feel immediately reinvigorated, you feel yourself young and strong as never before.\n The legends were true and you've been one of the very few to find the source of eternal life and partake in it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen80;I shall be young forever!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen57001;You are dancing alongside your sisters under the pale moons. Your head is a little light from all you've drank and in a pirouette you inadvertitely fall giggling on [From.GetFirstName] she laughs as well, falling with you and likely just as drunk.\n The sand is cold, but you feel her body warm on yours and quickly search for her lips.\n When you're tired and your head starts clearing a bit, you find yourself hugging each other near the camp fire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen57001;Oh, I love you, [From.GetFirstName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBslizardmen57001;We sure had a good fling!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTOPTBslizardmen57002;We sure had a good fling!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen57003;[From.GetFirstName] shares your feelings for her. It appears this year Serena bore more than just lust with her.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen57003;I love you too!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCslizardmen57004;You spend some more time cuddling [From.GetFirstName] before you laugh it off and get back to the other. It was certainly a crazy night.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen57004;We should do this again sometimes…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCQslizardmen63001;You strike [From.GetFirstName] at the ankle with the side of your spear, forcing her on her knees, but she quickly thrusts her weapon at you in retaliation. You step back, avoiding her spear, and she takes advantage of it to throw herself at your legs.\n You roll together in the sand, wrestling for control over your spear, until you finally manage to stop on top of her, squeezing her neck between your legs and pointing the spear at her face with a triumphant yell.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCRslizardmen63001;[From.GetFirstName] exchanges a few blows with you before pointing her spear on the ground to use it as lever and kick you in the face. \n Temporarely dazed by her attack, you try to step back, but she keeps close, drawing first blood from your arm in an attempt to loosen your grip on your weapon. You hold the spear and attempt a counterattack with one hand, but you can't put enough strength in the weapon to parry hers. In the end, driven by frustration, you just throw the spear, managing to get it through her leg and achieving victory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCSslizardmen63001;The fight doesn't start in the best way: [From.GetFirstName] manages to push you down with her shoulder, sliding her spear on the back of your neck, pressing your face against the sand.\n You feel your mind sleeping away as you wiggle, trying to breathe, but finally manage to break her hold with a violent kick on her knee. You crouch and snatch away her spear, battering your head on her chest and holding her down until she surrenders.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCTslizardmen63001;The fight starts well, you push [From.GetFirstName] down, take her hair from behind and start banging her head on the sand.\n [From.GetFirstName] struggles, but you keep your hold until she seems to be finally losing her strength. It is at that point that she rolls on the side, grabbing your spear and pushing it back to your jaw.\n You shake away the pain and wave the spear to free it from her hold, finally managing to pin her back down and squeeze her until she passes out.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCUslizardmen63001;You strike [FromFrom.GetFirstName] at the ankle with the side of your spear, forcing her on her knees, but she quickly thrusts her weapon at you in retaliation.

With both weapons pointed at you, you are forced to admit defeat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslizardmen82001;It is a very good day for a hunt and all the needs of command tend to take your [GetFromRelation] away from the true meaning of Amazonian lifestyle. Maybe you should ask her to go on a hunt with you, make sure her senses are still keen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen82001;Certainly!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBslizardmen82001;Maybe another time…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslizardmen82002;[From.GetFirstName] has come to you asking if you'd like to go out with her for a hunt. The day is bright and a exotic creatures await for your blades and arrows. What do you say?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen82002;Yes, please! I can't stand it here!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBslizardmen82002;I'm kind of busy right now…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslizardmen83;It gets discomforting, at times, how the burden of command prevents you from enjoying life like any other huntress, running in the wilds, stalking monsters. When those thoughts start festering your mind, you can only find solace in a good barrel of ripplejuice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBslizardmen83;The burden of command might not allow you to enjoy life like any huntress, running in the wilds, but that doesn't mean you have to wither away on your throne. You have still many friends at court and many fun ways to spend your nights without going through the trouble of hunting.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen83;…And anoth-*hic*er for me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslizardmen84;The pleasure of hunting down your own food is better than any delicacy. Yet, forced to spend all this time in your palace, you have had to give it up to the other huntresses. Is it so hard to think you'd experience that taste once more?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBslizardmen84;You let out an annoyed sigh, pinching a roll of fat at your hip. Amazons are meant to run free, hunt and fight, it's not your fault you've been burdened by the duty of command. Your body is just not accustomed to staying still for so long.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen84;It's not really my fault…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslizardmen85;You stumble on the carpet, letting out a whimper when you scratch your elbow on the ground. You used to be stronger, you used to be tougher, but being forced to spend so much time at palace, making and upholding rules and resolving disputes… It tires you without strengthening you, while your body slowly withers away.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBslizardmen85;You take a look at your arm, skinny and pale. It's hard to imagine how it was when you still had muscles in it. But how can an Amazon flourish, captive in her own palace? You feel so ashamed at yourself, how can you be the strong ruler your sisters look up to when you can barely lift a spear?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen85;I feel so frail…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslizardmen86;You don't need to search excitement outside in the jungle! You can have all you want, you're a Queen of Amazonia! Fruit, meat, males, girls, all you can think of can be given with a snap of your fingers. Why should you care about the bad rumors about you? They come from envious people, and should be disregarded as such.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBslizardmen86;You don't need to search excitement outside in the jungle! You can have all you want, you're a Queen of Amazonia! Fruit, meat, males, girls, all you can think of can be given with a snap of your fingers. And you can share it too, so that all the huntresses can enjoy pleasures beyond their wildest dreams, just like you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen86;Let's party!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslizardmen87;You had a lot of fun with [FromFrom.GetFirstName], even though she was clearly out of your league. When you returned back at palace, all covered in mud, sweat and blood, all loaded with meat and trophies, you were exhausted, but you felt alive more than ever.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen87;We should do this more often!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslizardmen87001;You had a lot of fun hunting with [From.GetFirstName], although you barely managed to land a few blows on the critters of the jungle. She really is worthy of respect, a ruler like her, still so skilled with the bow.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen87001;We should do this more often!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslizardmen89;This hunt is turning into a disaster. You barely made it out alive until now, you got separated from [FromFrom.GetFirstName] and are lost at night in the jungle. You don't know yet if you'll manage to reach home in time, if you do, you might want to think through before accepting to go on another wild hunt.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen89;Help!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslizardmen89001;This hunt is turning into a disaster. You barely made it out alive until now, you got separated from [From.GetFirstName] and are lost at night in the jungle. You don't know yet if you'll manage to reach home in time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen89001;Help!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslizardmen88;The hunt is proceding fairly well. Both you and [From.GetFirstName] are having fun and have captured a couple of small preys. As you go on though, it becomes clear you're evenly matched and that is enough to spark the spirit of competition within the both of you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen88;We'll see who catches the bigger game!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslizardmen88001;The Culchan shrieks when you jump from the tree and land on his back. [From.GetFirstName] is ready to point her spear at him, rising from her cover, but the giant bird ignores and tramples her, running away and trying to shake you off.\n You hold onto your spear, sunking it deeper in the back of the Culchan. You're finally thrown off the prey, but you roll easily back on your feet, catching [From.GetFirstName]'s spear and throwing it right on the creature's flank.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBslizardmen88001;A Naggaront you could handle, but, when you entered the cave, you didn't expect to find a nest. At that point it was too late to call off the attack, the two creatures had already caught your stench.\n You throw an arrow at the first, managing to land a lucky shot in its eyes and running for the exit, where [From.GetFirstName] waits for you.\n You put down your spears right before the monsters come out, managing to have them impale themselves with their own charge.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCCslizardmen88001;You and [From.GetFirstName] run around in circles, yelling at the top of your lungs, but never leaving the safety of the trees as the pack of crazed Stegandons growls and trumpets, trying to find a way out of the fire you started.\n When the stampede finally gets underway, you start trowing arrows at them, until you've singled out the weaker reptile. Slowed the creature down, you jump on its back together, thrusting your spears many times over in the fissue at the back of its neck, under its bone collar.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCDslizardmen88001;You keep holding your breath, eyes pointed up as the Terradon slowly approaches the surface of the river to drink. At the last possible moment, you swim out, charging your spear through the creature's chest. The Terradon shrieks, flapping his wings in an attempt to flee.\n You wrap your arms around his neck while [From.GetFirstName] jumps on his back and stabs him again.\n For a few seconds you are left hanging over the trees, but the Terradon cannot sustain the both of you while wounded and finally crashes down, dead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCEslizardmen88001;You jump behind a rock just in time to avoid the jet of fire spitted by the angry salamander. Quickly putting out a spark in your hair, you look for [From.GetFirstName], readying your bow. The other huntress is crouched on a tree, already aiming. The moment she fires the salamander stops and you leave cover, shooting a second arrow straight into its mouth.\n The monster jerks and coughs, before trying to get out another firey breath, but at that point you have already managed to get close enough to bury your spear under his neck.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCFslizardmen88001;Hunting down the little lizard led you to an unknown abandoned ruin. You decided to explore it, but a few steps inside and you are already fending off spikey walls, fall pits and poisonous darts.\n You get separated from [From.GetFirstName] and decided to proceed on your own. You carefully avoid a series of false steps and reach the final chamber. The snake idol exposed there is just too pretty to be left alone, but when you take it, a giant boulder falls from above. It is right when you're fleeing for your life that you stumble on [From.GetFirstName] and barely manage to cross the temple's door before getting squashed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCGslizardmen88001;The Miyans were not amused when you stole all of their game, but what were you supposed to do? You didn't have any luck in finding decent preys. The little men yell and shoot darts at you as you run with [From.GetFirstName], charged with meat and pelts. You slide to a river and follow its course with the little pests on your heels, then jump off when you reach a waterfall, barely managing to swim back to surface after you land in the torrent with all that extra weight. You quickly run into the wild, before the Miyans may find a safer way down.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCHslizardmen88001;You hold your breath, pressing behind the tree, looking into every corner, trying to spot the creature. [From.GetFirstName] lays a few feets away, unconscious from a poisoned dart. You barely managed to avoid a similar fate, but now you have to bring her back home immediately. The hunter hisses from the shadows, invisible. You fire a warning shot in what you think it's his general direction, but no avail. Finally, you catch a movement in the leaves and shoot again, this time wounding him. The creature shrieks and you, taking advantage of the distraction, take [From.GetFirstName] and try and run for it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCIslizardmen88001;The Kroxigor roars, ignoring the wounds on his side and under his eyes. He lowers his head and charges [From.GetFirstName]. The huntress manages to avoid the worst of it, but she's still knocked off. You throw your spear at the creature's back while it's charging your mate, but the Kroxigor just takes the spear out with a grunt and throws it away.\n You plant another arrow near his eye, enraging him further and wait to the last second before jumping away from its charge. The Kroxigor ends sticking his horns on the side of a tree. Before he manages to tear it off, you're back with your spear, plunging it again and again in his back until he finally collapses.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCLslizardmen88001;You yell and charge against the Spinodon, falling on your knees at the last second and plunging your spear under his chest, where his scales are thinner. [From.GetFirstName] joins you, attacking him from the side and trying to roll it over, but the creature manages to whip its tails at her, pushing her away. You keep a firm hold on your spear, keeping the Spinodon's jaws away as more and more of his blood spills over you, soaking your skin and enticing your senses. Finally, the monster stops, hanging his head on your weapon, dead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCMslizardmen88001;The Carnosaur's jaws snap a few inches from [From.GetFirstName]'s back, taking away a few of her hair in the process. You're a little further, running from the beast.\n You've tried your best, but this doesn't seem like a creature to take down with just two huntresses.\n The reptile roars, carelessly uprooting trees as it pursues you in its frenzy. [From.GetFirstName] almost get trampled at a certain point, but you manage to push her on the side in time. The Carnosaur only stops when you jump off a cliff, roughly landing on some trees.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCNslizardmen88001;The Culchan shrieks when you jump from the tree and land on his back. [FromFrom.GetFirstName] is ready to point her spear at him, rising from her cover, but the giant bird ignores and tramples her, running away and trying to shake you off.\n You hold onto your spear, sunking it deeper in the back of the Culchan. You're finally thrown off the prey, but you roll easily back on your feet, catching [FromFrom.GetFirstName]'s spear and throwing it right on the creature's flank.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESCTslizardmen88001;The Miyans were not amused when you stole all of their game, but what were you supposed to do? You didn't have any luck in finding better prey. The little men yell and shoot darts at you as you run with [FromFrom.GetFirstName], loaded with meat and pelts. You slide to a river and follow its course with the little pests on your heels, then jump off when you reach a waterfall, barely managing to swim back to surface after you land in the torrent with all that extra weight. You quickly run into the wild, before the Miyans may find a safer way down.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCUslizardmen88001;You hold your breath, pressing behind the tree, looking into every corner, trying to spot the creature. [FromFrom.GetFirstName] lays a few feets away, unconscious from a poisoned dart. You barely managed to avoid a similar fate, but now you have to bring her back home immediately. The hunter hisses from the shadows, invisible. You fire a warning shot in what you think it's his general direction, but no avail. Finally, you catch a movement in the leaves and shoot again, this time wounding him. The creature shrieks and you, taking advantage of the distraction, take [FromFrom.GetFirstName] and try and run for it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCVslizardmen88001;The Kroxigor roars, ignoring the wounds on his side and under his eyes. He lowers his head and charges [FromFrom.GetFirstName]. The huntress manages to avoid the worst of it, but she's still knocked off. You throw your spear at the creature's back while it's charging your mate, but the Kroxigor just takes the spear out with a grunt and throws it away.\n You plant another arrow near his eye, enraging him further and wait to the last second before jumping away from its charge. The Kroxigor ends sticking his horns on the side of a tree. Before he manages to tear it off, you're back with your spear, plunging it again and again in his back until he finally collapses.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCWslizardmen88001;You yell and charge against the Spinodon, falling on your knees at the last second and plunging your spear under his chest, where his scales are thinner. [FromFrom.GetFirstName] joins you, attacking him from the side and trying to roll it over, but the creature manages to whip its tails at her, pushing her away. You keep a firm hold on your spear, keeping the Spinodon's jaws away as more and more of his blood spills over you, soaking your skin and enticing your senses. Finally, the monster stops, hanging his head on your weapon, dead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCXslizardmen88001;The Carnosaur's jaws snap a few inches from [FromFrom.GetFirstName]'s back, taking away some of her hair in the process. You're a little further, running from the beast.\n You've tried your best, but this doesn't seem like a creature to take down with just two huntresses.\n The reptile roars, carelessly uprooting trees as it pursues you in its frenzy. [FromFrom.GetFirstName] almost get trampled at a certain point, but you manage to push her away in time. The Carnosaur only stops when you jump off a cliff, roughly landing on some trees.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen88001;Goddesses!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslizardmen88002;The Culchan shrieks when [From.GetFirstName] jump from the tree and lands on his back. You are ready to point your spear at him, rising from cover, but the giant bird ignores and tramples you, running away and trying to shake [From.GetFirstName] off.\n She holds onto her spear, sinking it deeper in the back of the Culchan. She's finally thrown off the prey, but rolls easily back on her feet, catching your spear and throwing it right on the creature's flank.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBslizardmen88002;A Naggaront [From.GetFirstName] could handle, but, when she entered the cave, she didn't expect to find a nest. At that point it was too late to call off the attack, the two creatures had already caught her stench.\n She throws a spear at the first, managing to land a lucky shot in its eyes and running for the exit, where you await for her.\n You put down your spears right before the monsters come out, managing to have them impale themselves with their own charge.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCCslizardmen88002;You and [From.GetFirstName] run around in circles, yelling at the top of your lungs, but never leaving the safety of the trees as the pack of crazed Stegandons growls and trumpets, trying to find a way out of the fire you started.\n When the stampede finally gets underway, you start throwing spears at them, until you've singled out the weakest reptile. Having slowed the creature down, you jump on its back together, thrusting your spears many times over in the fissure at the back of its neck, under its bone collar.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCDslizardmen88002;[From.GetFirstName] keeps holding her breath, eyes pointed up as the Terradon slowly approaches the surface of the river to drink. At the last possible moment, she swims out, charging her spear through the creature's chest. The Terradon shrieks, flapping his wings in an attempt to flee.\n [From.GetFirstName] wraps her arms around his neck while you jump on his back and stab him again.\n For a few seconds you are left hanging over the trees, but the Terradon cannot sustain the both of you while wounded and finally crashes down, dead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCEslizardmen88002;[From.GetFirstName] jumps behind a rock just in time to avoid the jet of fire spitted by the angry salamander. Quickly putting out a spark in her hair, she looks up for you, readying her bow. In the meantime, you, crouched on a tree, are already aiming. The moment you fire, the salamander stops and [From.GetFirstName] leaves cover, shooting a second arrow straight into its mouth.\n The monster jerks and coughs, before trying to get out another firey breath, but at that point [From.GetFirstName] has already managed to get close enough to bury her spear under his neck.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCFslizardmen88002;Hunting down the little lizard led you to an unknown abandoned ruin. You decided to explore it, but a few steps inside and you are already fending off spiked walls, pit traps and poisonous darts.\n You get separated from [From.GetFirstName] and decided to proceed on your own. Sadly, you don't get very far before remaining stuck in a dead end and have to walk all the way back from where you started. It is at this point that you find [From.GetFirstName], with a golden idol under her arm, fleeing as a giant round boulder rolls down the hall behind her! You barely manage to get out before getting squashed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCGslizardmen88002;The Miyans were not amused when you stole all of their game, but what were you supposed to do? You didn't have any luck in finding decent prey. The little men yell and shoot darts at you as you run with [From.GetFirstName], loaded with meat and pelts. You come across a river and follow its course with the little pests on your heels, then jump off when you reach a waterfall. Sadly, you have to abandon half your load to swim back to the surface, where you quickly run into the wild before the Miyans are able find a way down.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCHslizardmen88002;You were stalking a smaller lizard when something called. The distraction was enough to catch you off-guard as a poisoned dart pierced your neck. You only manage to spot a couple of shining eyes in the leaves before losing consciousness. \n When you recover, [From.GetFirstName] is carrying you frantically through the jungle, still escaping from the elusive monster.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCIslizardmen88002;The Kroxigor roars, ignoring the wounds on his side and on his face. He lowers his head and charges you. While you manage to avoid the worst of it, you are still knocked down. [From.GetFirstName] throws her spear at the creature's back while it's charging you, but the Kroxigor just rips the spear out with a grunt and discards it.\n [From.GetFirstName] plants another arrow near his eye, enraging him further, and wait till the last second before jumping away from its feral charge. The Kroxigor ends sticking his horns on the side of a tree. Before he manages to tear it off, she's back with her spear, plunging it again and again in his hide until he finally collapses.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCLslizardmen88002;[From.GetFirstName] yells and charges against the Spinodon, falling on her knees at the last second and plunging her spear under his chest, where his scales are thinner.

EVTOPTAslizardmen88002;That was hard…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslizardmen88003;You had a lot of fun in this hunt, even though your companion was clearly out of your league. When you returned back at palace, all covered in mud, sweat and blood, all loaded with meat and trophies, you were exhausted, but you felt alive more than ever.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAslizardmen88003;We should do this more often!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAslizardmen88004;While not a bad experience, you certainly had quite a few scares during this hunt. If you died, who would have led the Amazons?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

lizardman261desc;Keeping the dense jungle of Lustria at bay is a constant and dangerous struggle.

lizardman400desc;Long ago, in the time when Chaos came to the world, Oxyotl was one of the rarest breeds of Skink: a Chameleon who could control the colour of his scales at will. He and his band defended Mage-Lord Pocaxalan in his last-ditch effort to save the city with a great spell. But alas, the fickle powers of Chaos tricked Pocaxalan, and he tapped too deeply into the howling Winds of Magic —  The Slann and his last protectors were sucked into the Realm of Chaos.\n\nNo more Chameleon Skinks spawned after the disappearance of Oxyotl. Now, somehow, he has returned from the Realm of Chaos, and the Chameleons have begun to appear again. Chameleon Skinks do not dwell within the temple-cities, but instead strike out deep into the Lustrian jungles. During invasions or times of war, they appear to put themselves at the disposal of the Skink Chiefs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
