creature_fimir_desc;The Fimir are an ancient race of Cyclops-like, half-daemonic monsters that inhabit the marshes and bogs of the old world. Long ago, these twisted and evil creatures were the chosen servants of the Dark Gods, but when the first of Mankind arrived, the Fimir lost the favor of their patrons, and their dark empire fell. Now, most live in Ruined, Desolate fortresses and castles deep in the bogs and marshes of the old world.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

fimir_shearl_desc;The Shearl are the lowest in the Fimir caste system, being the 'drones' of the race. They are a stupid, slow-witted bunch, and are mostly used as chaff for the nobles and warriors.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fimir_fimm_desc;The Fimm are the second highest class in the Fimir caste system, being the warriors and nobles of the race. While they are about as intelligent as an Ork, they have the same brutish strength and behaviour, easily overpowering a man.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fimir_noble_desc;The Fimm are the second highest class in the Fimir caste system, being the warriors and nobles of the race. While they are about as intelligent as an Ork, they have the same brutish strength and behaviour, easily overpowering a man.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fimir_dirach_desc;The Dirach are the third highest class of the Fimir caste system, being the wizards and priests of the race. Much like the Meargh, they are highly intelligent, and the Dirach are capable of controlling and binding Daemons to their services, such as Nuckelavees. While not as powerful as a trained Human wizard, Dirach are still very deadly, and can demolish scores of soldiers in seconds.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fimir_maergh_desc;The Maergh are the highest class of the Fimir caste system, being the undisputed rulers of the race. Born scarcely more than a single one per century in any given clan, the Maergh are the only females in Fimir society. Even though are not the mothers of the Fimir, all Fimir in a clan would gladly lie down their lives to protect her.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
