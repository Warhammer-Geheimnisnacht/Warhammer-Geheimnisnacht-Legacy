creature_chaos_dwarf;Chaos Dwarf;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
creature_chaos_dwarf_desc;This character is a Chaos Dwarf. Chaos Dwarfs, or Dawi Zharr, are a divergent branch of dwarfs that were trapped in the northern reaches of the world when the power of Chaos waxed. Choosing to serve the daemonic god Hashut, they have since accumulated a considerable array of small mutations and other unique traits, none of them pleasant. Unlike their dwarf cousins they are capable of using magic, but their natural resistance causes them to eventually turn to stone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
chaos_dwarf_sorcerer;Chaos Dwarf Sorcerer - §GBattle Magic Pool([This.MagicPool.GetValue]/[This.MagicPoolMax.GetValue])§!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
chaos_dwarf_sorcerer_desc;The Sorcerer-Prophets are the great masters of the Chaos Dwarf race, directing the labours of their slaves and the conquests of their armies, their sorcerous powers granted by the Bullfather, Hashut. Thanks to their dark patron, they have completely embraced the arts of magic, with a dire price. Since Dwarfs were never meant to practise magic, over time a Chaos Dwarf Sorcerer will gradually turn to stone, starting from their feet, until the entire body is consumed and they becomes a statue. This trait also gives access to spells from the Lore of Hashut.\n§GSummons Spell Units during battles§!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
chaos_dwarf_petrification_1;Minor Sorcerer's Curse;;;;;;;;;;;;x
chaos_dwarf_petrification_1_desc;This character is starting to suffer from the effects of the Sorcerer's Curse, an ailment that transforms all Dwarfs that try to cast magic into stone.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME_hashut_sac;A Sacrifice to Hashut;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_hashut_sac;Your guards bring [From.GetTitledFirstName] up the stairs of the temple, towards to a great, brazen statue of Hashut at it's highest point, which has a pool of liquid, molten metal beneath it that acts as a furnace. As the temple's Bull Centaur places [From.GetHerHim] close to the furnace, you hear the mumblings of a [From.Religion.GetName] prayer to [From.Religion.GetHighGodName].\n\nThe Bull Centaur looks to you, his sturdy skin, blessed by Hashut, unaffected by the extreme heat that comes off the statue's furnace. With a nod from you, he will throw the sacrifice into the furnace...;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_hashut_sacrifice_killed;The monstrous Bull Centaur plunges you into the pool of molten metal. You scream in agony as your skin melts, and see nothing more...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_hashut_boons;"You enter [Root.Location.GetName]'s temple ritual room, and the acolytes prepare the altar for your audience with Lord Hashut by plunging a couple of slaves into the temple's furnace, as the ritual follows, you kneel and prostrate 3 times before a great statue of the Bullfather, glowing red-hot due to the burning coals inside it. Choking smoke inundates the chamber and you hear a booming, metallic voice, coming from all places in the room and none:\nASK FOR THY REWARD, MY SERVANT...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_hashut_bless_me;Great Hashut, grant me the Gift of Infernal Fire!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_hashut_bless_provinces_forges;Mighty Hashut, bless my lands with the Power of Molten Rock!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_hashut_centaur_bulls;Father Hashut, grant me the aid of your greatest servants, the Bull Centaurs!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_chaos_dwarf_sorcerer;"As you enter the ritual chamber, at the tip of [Root.Location.GetName]'s greatest ziggurat-temple, you notice that the acolytes have prepared everything for your great ceremony of ascension into a Sorcerer-Prophet of Hashut. A hundred slaves, the best specimens from your pits, have been brought as offerings to the Bullfather.\nOne by one, all the slaves are dropped into the fiery pools of molten metal underneath the effigy of Hashut by the temple's Bull Centaurs. The acolytes, enthralled, start singing dirges to Hashut:\nO Bullfather, this sacrifice which we now slay upon Your altar!\nRejoice, drink of its slave blood and feast on its slave flesh!\nMay Your fire and smoke be content to offer naught but power!\n\nYou move towards the altar before the brazen idol, and raise your hands...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_hashut_grant_me;ALL FOR HASHUT!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_chaos_dwarf_sorcerer_succeed;"As the cavernous sound of the acolytes' dirges wanes, a chocking cloud of ash and smoke fills the room. A powerful voice resonates from the brazen idol's head:\nLET THIS BE A TESTAMENT OF HASHUT'S MIGHT, THIS SERVANT HAS NOW BEEN GRANTED POWER TO SUBJUGATE THE WINDS OF MAGIC IN MY NAME!\n All Chaos Dwarfs in the room prostrate before these words, and you follow example. You feel a new power stirring inside you...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_praise_hashut;Praise Hashut!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_chaos_dwarf_sorcerer_fail;As the cavernous sound of the acolytes' dirges wanes, a chocking cloud of ash and smoke fills the room... you a strange sensation in goes through your body. Is this Hashut's greatest gift? As you search yourself for any changes, you notice that your feet don't move any more... they have turned into stones. As the curse quickly creeps through the rest of your body, you can only hear a booming, metalling laughter before you're fully entrapped into stone...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_so_close_chaosdwarf;I was so... close...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAsorcererscurse;You have noticed that as of late, your feet and hands, starting from your toes and fingers, have started to petrify into black stone. It is clear, the dreaded Sorcerer's Curse is starting to affect you. You're still able to move independently, but you've clearly lost mobility, and your servants start to think you as weak...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBsorcererscurse;The Sorcerer's Curse has almost completely claimed your body. You the entirety of your lower body has petrified into black stone, and you can barely move your arms. Though you can still talk and think with clarity, it's obvious to everyone that you're no longer fit to rule, and many of your servants see you as weak...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCsorcererscurse;As your head is completely petrified into black stone you compose a stern expression, knowing that your body will become a testament to Hashut's power, littering the highways to Zharr-Naggrund next to the petrified bodies of the other Sorcerer-Prophets.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOTPAsorcererscurse;Curses!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOTPBsorcererscurse;Hashut's balls!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOTPCsorcererscurse;I go to the Bullfather...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAchaosdwarf_slave_raid;The province of [From.GetName] has been raided and burned to the ground by our great hosts, its pathetic inhabitants subjugated before the might of [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] and Father Hashut. Where shall we send our new slaves?;;;;;;;;;;;;xx
EVTOTPAchaosdwarf_slave_raid;They shall be sent to toil in [Root.Capital.GetName]'s great factories!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOTPBchaosdwarf_slave_raid;These wretches shall be part of [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName]'s hosts!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOTPDchaosdwarf_slave_raid;This scum is only worthy as sacrifice! Throw them into Hashut's furnaces!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAchaosdwarf_slave_building_capital;The Chaos Dwarf slave buildings ( Chaos Dwarf Factory and Slave Levy ) can only be present in your capital holding. If you have any of these buildings in a non-capital province, they will be destroyed and a level of the respective building will be added to your capital.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPFACTORYCAPITAL;A level of Chaos Dwarf Factory will be added to [Root.Capital.GetName];;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPSLEVYCAPITAL;A level of Slave Levy will be added to [Root.Capital.GetName];;;;;;;;;;;;x
#EVTDESC_chaos_dwarf_sell_slave;You bring [From.GetTitledFirstName] to [Root.Capital.GetName]'s slave markets in order to be sold to the highest bidder. [From.GetFirstName] will be sold into slavery and will be functionally dead.\nThe higher the base stats of the slave, the more gold you'll get for selling [From.GetHerHim]...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_chaos_dwarf_sell_slave;I'm sure this one will sell nicely...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_chaos_dwarf_sell_slave;Your wretched master, [From.GetTitledFirstName], has decided to finally sell you in the slave markets of [From.Capital.GetName]. You know that being sold into slavery by the Chaos Dwarfs is a sentence of death... and so you can only curse your fate.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_CD_curse_master;Curse you, [From.GetTitledFirstName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_chaos_dwarf_buy_stuff;"You have decided to buy armaments from the Chaos Dwarfs of [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName]. [From.GetTitledFirstName] receives you at the gates of [From.Capital.GetName]: Welcome to Mighty [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName], [Root.Culture.GetName]! Which grand creation of the Dawi Zharr do you wish to purchase?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOTPA_chaos_dwarf_buy_weapons;I wish to buy Chaos weapons and armours for my warriors!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOTPB_chaos_dwarf_buy_hellcannons;A regiment of mighty Doomcannons!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOTPB_chaos_dwarf_buy_stuff;I will buy nothing from you squat weaklings!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCchaos_dwarf_buy_weapons;[From.GetTitledFirstName], a [From.Culture.GetName] from [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName] has come to [Root.Capital.GetName] seeking to purchase Chaos armours and weapons from our factories to arm [Root.GetHerHis] warriors.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCchaos_dwarf_buy_hellcannons;[From.GetTitledFirstName], a [From.Culture.GetName] from [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName] has come to [Root.Capital.GetName] seeking to purchase a regiment of mighty Doomcanon infernal engines from our factories.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOTPA_chaos_dwarf_sell_weapons;Very well! Get those armaments ready!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOTPA_chaos_dwarf_sell_hellcannons;Very well! Get those Doomcannons ready!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOTPB_chaos_dwarf_sell_nothing;No! I won't sell anything to a filthy [From.Culture.GetName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_chaos_dwarf_payment;Now that you've decided what to purchase from [From.Capital.GetName]'s factories, you have to pay the price for it. The Chaos Dwarfs accept payments in gold or slaves. If you wish to pay in slaves, you'll need to either give them slaves from your own pits or some inhabitants of your capital province.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOTPA_chaos_dwarf_payment_money;I will pay in gold!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOTPA_chaos_dwarf_payment_slaves;I will pay in slaves from my own pits!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_chaos_dwarf_wont_pay;That's incredibly expensive. Maybe next time.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOTPA_chaos_dwarf_payment_own_slaves;The people of [Root.Capital.GetName] shall be my payment!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_chaos_dwarf_payment_made_money;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has decided to pay in gold. While it isn't a payment as good as slaves would have been, it's still good enough.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_chaos_dwarf_payment_made_slaves;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has decided to pay you in slaves from [From.GetHerHis] pits. The slaves appear to be weary, having been taken from many lands and races, but are still in good condition to work in our factories or serve in our hosts.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_chaos_dwarf_payment_made_own_slaves;Amusingly enough, [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName] has decided to chain [From.GetHerHis] own people in [From.Capital.GetName] and send them to you as slaves! The [From.Culture.GetName] slaves appear to be in a decent condition, enough to work in our factories or serve in our hosts!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOTPA_chaos_dwarf_payment_made_money;It is enough indeed.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOTPA_chaos_dwarf_payment_made_slaves;A thousand slaves for our toil!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOTPA_chaos_dwarf_payment_made_own_slaves;A thousand slaves for our toil!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_chaos_dwarf_hellcannons_arrived;Finally, the detachment of Doomcannons that you brought from [From.GetTitledFirstName] has arrived at [Root.Capital.GetName]!

EVTDESC_chaos_dwarf_weapons_arrived;The Chaos weapons and armour you brought from [From.GetTitledFirstName] have finally arrived at [Root.Capital.GetName]!

EVTOTPAchaosdwarf_send_slaves_to_building;New, fresh slaves have arrived at [Root.Capital.GetName]. Where shall we send them to work?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_chaos_dwarf_great_taurus;Most of the Great Tauruses in the plains of Zharrduk come from the breeding pens under the temple of Hashut in Zharr-Naggrund. While most of the beasts there are fully grown, it takes time for the Chaos Dwarf Sorcerers to attune the beast's binding enchantments to a new rider. These rituals will be completed in 5 years.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_chaos_dwarf_great_taurus;Outside of the plains of Zharrduk, the Great Tauruses can only be found in their natural habitats, inside the calderas of active volcanoes. You have managed to convince one of the Bull Centaurs guarding [From.Capital.GetName]'s temple to snatch a young calf from one of the nearby volcanoes. The beast will be fully grown and magically bound in 5 years.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_chaos_dwarf_great_taurus;Excellent;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_chaos_dwarf_great_taurus_trained;Finally, the Great Taurus is tamed, the magical beast's binding enchantments fully attuned so that it obeys your will completely. The Great Tauruses are considered by the Chaos Dwarfs to be the living images of Hashut, great, winged bulls surrounded by a wreathing aura of infernal flame.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_chaos_dwarf_great_taurus_trained;On wings of fire and smoke I soar!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_chaos_dwarf_lamassu;Only the Sorcerer-Prophets of Hashut have the magical prowess to master a Lammasu as their mount. But these beasts cannot be binded by magic alone, like the Great Tauruses. Lammasus are cunning, intelligent beasts, and must as well be bargained within order to be completely mastered, for not even the Dawi Zharr would dare mount a Lammasu without pacting with it before. The process to find, convince and master a Lammasu will take 5 years.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_chaos_dwarf_lamassu;Excellent;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_chaos_dwarf_lamassu_trained;Finally, the Lammasu has been brought down to your service, through equal parts of deceit and magical skill. The Lammasus are beasts of insidious cunning, resembling Great Tauruses in it's bovine body, leathery wings and back quarters, but with clawed forelimbs and an eerie bearded, and horned face, resembling a Chaos Dwarf in many ways.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_chaos_dwarf_lamassu_trained;Hashut favours me!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOTPCchaosdwarf_slave_raid;Take them as slaves, and burn this land!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBchaosdwarf_slave_raid;The province of [From.GetName] has been raided and burned to the ground by our great hosts. Most of your overseers are on their way to [Root.Capital.GetName], herding the slaves you previously captured in another assault, but your personal entourage can still herd a small quantity of them...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_chaos_dwarf_must_sacrifice;For too long have the furnaces at [Root.Capital.GetName] remained silent and devoid of any kind of offering. You have gone 4 years without a proper sacrifice to Hashut. The Father of Darkness does not look kindly upon those who fail to pay Him tribute...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_chaos_dwarf_must_sacrifice;I'm sure the Bullfather doesn't mind...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_hashut_great_sacrifice;The acolytes of Hashut have prepared the furnaces at the top of [Root.Capital.GetName]'s ziggurat for your grand sacrifice ceremony by chanting the sacred dirges. Now is the time, to offer the souls of slaves and wretches to the Bullfather, so that our Lord Hashut may feast on them.\n\nThe temple's Bull Centaurs look to you with anticipation, ready to retrieve the next sacrifice at your command...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_hashut_great_sacrifice;Herd in slaves from the factories!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_hashut_great_sacrifice;Bring the wretches that form our slave levies!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_hashut_great_sacrifice;Our prisoners shall have the honour to become sacrifice!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_hashut_great_sacrifice;I've changed my mind! Hashut doesn't deserve any gifts!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_hashut_great_sacrifice_prisoner;Your watch gleefully as the Bull Centaurs drag [From.GetTitledFirstName] up the stairs of the ziggurat, towards the great, brazen statue of Hashut, a pool of molten metal beneath it acts as it's furnace. As the Bull Centaur places [From.GetHerHim] close to the furnace, you hear the mumblings of a prayer to [From.Religion.GetHighGodName].\n\n[From.GetFirstName] tries to keep a stoic composure... but it soon fades into agony as [From.GetSheHe] is submerged into the molten metal...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_hashut_great_sacrifice_character_blessing;As the last of the sacrifice's laments echo through the chamber... you feel that your body is now strong as a Bull Centaur's and your mind is quick as a Daemon's... certainly, you have been blessed by the Bullfather!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_hashut_great_sacrifice_province_blessing;As the last of the sacrifice's laments echo through the chamber... you don't notice any changes, at first, but when you step out of the Zigurrat's ceremonal changer you notice that your whole land has been covered in a thick, red smoke which seems to be unnaturally empowering your forges and slaves, certainly [Root.Capital.GetName] has been blessed by the Bullfather!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_hashut_great_sacrifice_bull_centaurs_join;As the last of the sacrifice's laments echo through the chamber... you don't see any changes, at first, but when you step out of the Zigurrat's ceremonal changer you notice that a small regiment of Bull Centaurs is waiting at it's feet, willing to serve you! Clearly, this is Father Hashut's providence gracing us!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_hashut_great_sacrifice_hashut_angry;As the last of the sacrifice's laments echo through the chamber... you notice a cloud of red smoke forming in front of you, in a wink, it quickly files towards you and forces itself down your throat, making you pass out... when you awake, you're informed by the temple's Acolytes that you must have somehow earned Hashut's wrath, and indeed, you feel much weaker...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_hashut_great_sacrifice_hashut_angry;Curses!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_hashut_great_sacrifice_slaves;Your watch gleefully as the Bull Centaurs herd in masses of slaves up the stairs of the ziggurat, towards the great, brazen statue of Hashut, a pool of molten metal beneath it acts as it's furnace. As the Bull Centaur places them close to the furnace, you hear multiple mumbles and whimpers coming from the wretches.\n\nThey're pushed one by one into the pool of molten metal, their anguished laments forming a wonderful choir...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_hashut_great_sacrifice_slaves;Mighty Hashut! Accept the slave blood and slave flesh we offer thee!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CD_factory_decays;The slave population in [Root.Capital.GetName]'s factories has recently declined due to chocking smoke, factory accidents, famine and general mismanagement;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_CD_factory_decays;Hashut's cock! Well, we'll have to get more slaves...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CD_slave_levy_decays;The population in [Root.Capital.GetName]'s slave barracks has recently declined due to chocking smoke, incompetent hobgoblin overseers, famine and general mismanagement;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_CD_slave_levy_decays;Hashut's cock! Well, we'll have to get more slaves...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDR_chaos_dwarf.41;The Bullfather is pleased with your offering. As your sacrifice dissolves into the molten metal pit, you hear a booming voice coming from the brazen idol's head...offering you gifts;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTADR_chaos_dwarf.41;Grant me some of your fiery K'daai servants, to sear my enemies!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBDR_chaos_dwarf.41;Mighty Hashut, bless me with your strength!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCDR_chaos_dwarf.41;Great Hashut, touch my lands with your fire!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDDR_chaos_dwarf.41;Bullfather, grant me greater dominion over the Winds!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDR_chaos_dwarf.42;The Bullfather must be pleased with you, for after your sacrifice dissolves into the molten pit, a daemonic creature of fire and steel surges from it, pledging itself to your service;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTADR_chaos_dwarf.42;Bend to my will, daemon!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDR_chaos_dwarf43;As your sacrifice sinks into the molten metal, you hear a bellowing in the outside. Hashut has sent you a Great Taurus, one of his most favoured creatures!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTADR_chaos_dwarf43;I will soar on wings of fire!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDR_chaos_dwarf44;The Bullfather is pleased. You watch as the molten metal takes into different shapes and forms... showing images of yourself surrounded by power and riches!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTADR_chaos_dwarf44;It will all be mine!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDR_chaos_dwarf45;As the sacrifice sinks into the molten pit you hear the booming voice of Hashut in your head, praising you... His greatest son!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTADR_chaos_dwarf45;All will bow before me!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDR_chaos_dwarf46;After the sacrifice sinks into the molten metal pit, you receive visions of yourself... a crown of fire is on your brows, burning... burning, until naught but ash remains...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTADR_chaos_dwarf46;Why? What is the meaning of this?!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDR_chaos_dwarf47;As the sacrifice sinks into the molten pit you get closer to it, in order to receive your gift... when suddenly a gush of molten metal sprays you in the face;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTADR_chaos_dwarf47;AAAAGH!!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDR_chaos_dwarf48;At last the sacrifice dissolves into the molten pit of metal... and the ritual room is filled with a most dire silence. It seems that the Bullfather has ignored your offering!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTADR_chaos_dwarf48;Hashut's balls!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDR_chaos_dwarf49;Praise Mighty Hashut! After all the sacrifices and absolute servitude, the Bullfather has finally granted you His greatest of gifts: dominion over the Winds of Magic! Soon the whole world will be under your yoke, for now, you're one of the great, magnificent masters of the Dawi Zharr, a Sorcerer-Prophet!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTADR_chaos_dwarf49;ALL FOR HASHUT!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDR_chaos_dwarf_kdaai_summoned;The K'daai slowly takes form before you, a creature of magma and iron, half-daemon and half-raging fire. The circle holds and the daemon is yours to command.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCDR_chaos_dwarf_kdaai_summoned_else;Your ritual for [From.GetFirstName] was a success. You've managed to bind a searing K'daai to [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
