# DAWI EVENTS

SJDwarfevents.1.desc;There are a large variety of beers available at the feast. You have already had five flagons, it may be a good idea to stop drinking...;;;;;;;;;x

SJDwarfevents.1.option2;I am a Dwarf, not a drunkard!;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.2.desc;Your miners have found a rich vein of high quality gold ore which the miners have eagerly started to work on.;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.2.option1;What a pleasant surprise!;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.3.desc;A confused Dwarf has been found strolling around in the caves beneath [Capital.GetName]. He asks for your permission to stay at your court until he remembers who he was before and where he comes from.;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.3.option1;You can stay;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.3.option2;I got more important things to worry about.;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.4.desc;Masonry is an old Dwarf tradition. Compared to the other lesser races, it is highly sophisticated and very respected. A Dwarf mason does not only work with building residential areas but they also are the ones who have the honourable task of building the huge halls and intriguing chambers that cover most of the Dwarf Karaks. As these structures are some of the most magnificent in the known world so are the Dwarf masons rightfully regarded as the best masons in the world which they are fully aware of and find great pride in. Masonry isn't just a way to build their homes, it is an art form.;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.4.option1;Glory to the Dwarfs!;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.5.desc;You have tried to make a small statue of a Dwarf warrior. Despite the fact it barely resembles a Dwarf and the axe is way too small, it is still an improvement since before.;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.5.option1;A good attempt;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.6.desc;Your attempt at making a small statue of a Dwarf warrior failed miserably. Halfway through you accidentally broke the statue which probably didn't matter as the statue would have looked awful anyway.;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.6.option1;What a disappointment.;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.7.desc;There is a very rough wall in one the watchtowers in [Capital.GetName] which you have decided to smooth out. The wall actually ended up quite smooth even though there are some scratches in it.;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.7.option1;A good attempt;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.8.desc;There is a very rough wall in one of your watchtowers in [Capital.GetName] which you have decided to smooth out.But the wall ended up looking even worse than it was before and very unstable.;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.8.option1;We will have to rebuild the wall then...;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.9.desc;You have decided to join your masons in their daily work, you learnt a lot of new stuff and you are very confident that you can put that practice to the test.;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.9.option1;Very interesting;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.10.desc;You have decided to join your masons in their daily work. they carefully gave you some tips, but you had a very tough time understanding what they meant so you did not learn that much.;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.10.option1;What a shame;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.11.desc;You have decided to smooth out the very uneven floor in the throne room. The floor actually ended up quite smooth so you are mighty pleased with yourself now.;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.11.option1;I am not that bad of a mason after all!;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.12.desc;You have lately been smoothing out a rough part of floor in the throne room, but it ended in a complete disaster and you wouldn't be surprised if the floor is even more uneven now than before.;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.12.option1;I am so ashamed of myself...;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.13.desc;Your skills in masonry have improved significantly. You are now at the level of your own masons. Considering how good Dwarfs are at masonry it is quite an achievement!;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.13.option1;I am now a fully fledged mason!;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.14.desc;You decided a while back to engrave the pillars in your throne room, that you have now finally finished. The elaborate runes cover most of the pillars that stand firmly in your throne room.;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.14.option1;Well done, [Root.GetName]!;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.15.desc;You decided some time ago to engrave the pillars in your throne room. But you have at several points in the engraving accidentally left large cracks in the pillars so you sadly need to build new ones.;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.15.option1;Well that's annoying!;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.16.desc;You have for the last weeks been working on rebuilding the entrance to the castle as the entrance was very battered. The entrance now looks sturdier than ever before which pleases you enormously.;;:;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.16.option1;Well done, [Root.GetName]!;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.17.desc;While repairing the castle's entrance, it accidentally collapsed in on itself so you have been forced to reinforce the garrison with a couple of sellswords to guard the entrance in the meantime.;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.17.option1;How unfortunate!;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.18.desc;The reparations of the castles battlements have gone far better than expected, the battlements are not only stronger but also considerably more redoubtable!;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.18.option1;That will ward off any attackers;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.19.desc;The widening of the castle's battlements has not gone as planned as it ended up being very unstable and it has collapsed at some points along the wall. A complete rebuild of the walls is necessary.;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.19.option1;Oh oh...;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.20.desc;Your rival deserves to feel pain and what better way to make someone feel pain than to destroy what that person loves. In this case it is your rivals statues...;;;;;;;;;x

SJDwarfevents.20.option2;No, that is below me;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.21.desc;One morning when you come down to your statue workshop you suddenly see most of the statues have been crushed by some heavy tool. Several years of work now lie shattered on the floor.;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.21.option1;MY STATUES!!!;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.22.desc;[From.GetTitledName] has finally felt the pain that [From.GetSheHe] deserves. Rumours say that [From.GetSheHe] is devastated by [From.GetHerHis] loss and you can't stop yourself from grinning at the news.;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.22.option1;I am so sneaky!;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.23.desc;The road network in one of your provinces is severely lacking after a small flood which destroyed most of the bridges. But you and your masons might be able to rebuild them again...;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.23.option1;And we will build them even better this time;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.23.option2;I wasn't planning on travelling there anyway;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.24.desc;You haven't thought for a long time about creating a statue of one of three most important of the Ancestral Gods - Valaya, Grimnir or Grungni. But who will you choose?;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.24.option1;Grimnir, the warrior!;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.24.option2;Grungni, the smith!;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.24.option3;Valaya, the protector!;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.24.option4;I don't believe in Gods!;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.25.desc;Your hated rival can finally pay the final price which is nothing less than your rival's death! You have been thinking about a masterful plan involving some highly unstable mining tunnels...;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.25.option1;REVENGE!!!;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.25.option2;I am not a murderer...;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.26.desc;To succeed with your plan you must first find a tunnel that is highly unstable and one that would collapse at a seconds notice. And of course, you also must get your rival to the spot...;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.26.option1;The sweet taste of revenge!;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.27.desc;While walking around in the tunnels you suddenly get interrupted by a loud rumbling sound. You begin to run back and you barely manage to get away from the tunnel before it collapses.;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.27.option1;That was to close!;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.28.desc;While walking around in the tunnels you suddenly get interrupted by a loud rumbling sound. You begin to run back but you don't get far before a huge rock falls down upon you, killing you immediately.;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.28.option1;Noooooo!;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.29.desc;The plan was a failure. [From.GetName] managed to escape in time barely avoiding the large pieces of rock falling from the celling.;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.29.option1;What a shame;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.30.desc;Your plan was a success! The falling boulders crushed [From.GetName], killing [From.GetHerHim] instantly.;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.30.option1;I am so good at intrigue;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.31.desc;You have put your masonry skills to the test and started building a completely new mining system in one of your provinces and it ended up very successfully.;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.31.option1;Excellent;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.32.desc;You are now a masterful mason! There are few limits to what you can and cannot build and other Dwarfs often look upon you with envy in their eyes.;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.32.option1;Sounds exciting!;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.33.desc;You have lately been working on improving your throne room's engravings and you can't stop yourself from being very pleased with the result.;;;;;;;;;x

SJDwarfevents.34.desc;You have for a long time thought about making a large statue of yourself and then put that statue in some place where everyone can see it, like the entrance for example.;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.34.option1;I am worthy of the honour!;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.34.option2;Pride goes before fall;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.35.option2;This was a one time thing;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.36.desc;The Human beer served to you was nowhere near the taste of Dwarf beer, almost making you vomit. You feel a big urge to tell them exactly what you feel about their so called beer!;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.36.option1;Are you trying to poison me, manling!?;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.36.option2;I guess I better get used to the taste...;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.37.desc;You have recently invited the Dwarf [From.GetName] for a drink or two in your chamber but when [From.GetSheHe] tried it [From.GetSheHe] immediately started complaining about the beverages served.;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.37.option1;No we DO NOT have Dwarf beer here so stop complaining!;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.37.option2;I think you will like my Dwarf beer more...;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.37.option3;I should have bought some Dwarf beer before I invited [From.GetHerHim] over;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.38.desc;[From.GetName] got very angry when I voiced my opinion about the awful Human beer served and [From.GetSheHe] dismissed me with all of the needed courtesy.;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.38.option1;Hah, weak Manlings!;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.39.desc;When you voiced your opinion on the coloured water that the Humans call beer [From.GetSheHe] gave you some Dwarf beer instead. The conversation continued on smoothly with the help of a beer or two...;;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.39.option1;Nothing can beat Dwarf beer!;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.40.desc;Is it the Manlings who keep the Orcs at bay? Are the Elflings famous for their engineering? No, it is the Dwarfs and only Dwarfs who can do that and we should be proud of that!;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.40.option1;We are glorious!;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.40.option2;Pride goes before fall;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.42.desc;An ordinary part in a "regular" Dwarf's life is the regular visit to the local tavern to both drink the excellent beer served but to also spend some time with friends. But you are no "regular" Dwarf right?;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.42.option1;I should not let my responsibilities weigh me down!;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.42.option2;I think I will skip this time;;;;;;;;;
SJDwarfevents.42.option3;I don't have any time for that. Because I got work to do!;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.43.desc;The first things that enter your mind when you walk through the door into the cosy little tavern are the constant laughters and the singing from a dozen drunken Dwarfs on the right side of the tavern. To the left a couple of human merchants sit, trying out the Dwarf beer for the first time with several loud exclamations in their foreign tongue. Most other seats have already been taken by the Dwarf miners who just ended their mining shift and are now eager to have a drink, except for the seats far in the corner to the left who are almost completely covered in shadows. You take some fast steps forward but slow down when you realise that you don't know where to sit.;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.43.option1;I will sit by myself;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.43.option2;I have always wanted to know humans better;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.43.option3;I will go and join the singing Dwarfs at their table;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.44.desc;Suddenly a longbearded Dwarf with several large scars enters the tavern. He scans the room with his watchul eyes before he starts to walk towards your table. "May I join?" he asks.;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.44.option1;Sure;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.44.option2;Come up with some plausible excuse for saying no;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.45.desc;The veteran tells you some of the most fascinating stories of his adventures. But he also says that he has grown tired of adventuring and wants to settle down. Maybe you could offer him that?;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.45.option1;Welcome!;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.45.option2;I don't think that would be a good idea;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.46.desc;When you sit by yourself and have nothing to do except for drinking, it is quite hard to resist drinking. Dwarfs can drink a lot without even flinching but there is a limit...;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.46.option1;Who can resist proper Dwarf beer!;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.46.option2;I am a Dwarf, not a drunkard!;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.47.desc;Suddenly one of your courtiers appears and sits down at your table. You talk to each other till sunrise even though you barely manage to not fall asleep. Will you contact the courtier again?;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.47.option2;It was a one time thing;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.47.option1;We should do that again, my friend!;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.48.desc;It doesn't take long for the human traders to try to sell you something. In this case it is a book which they claim comes from one of the lost Dwarf holds.;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.48.option1;I will buy it;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.48.option2;It is obviously a fraud;;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.49.desc;The book you bought has now been confirmed to be a real one, coming from a hold which must have been destroyed such a long time ago so that no one even knows it's name.;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.49.option1;And it contains some very interesting knowledge;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.50.desc;The book you bought is a Dwarf book but instead of containing lost knowledge it is a badly written romantic fiction.;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.50.option1;Those humans will pay!;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.51.desc;The humans tells you the most fascinating stories about their homeland, giving you a further understanding about how the world is outside your hold. Because that was the truth wasn't it?;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.51.option1;Very interesting;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.52.desc;The humans are the representatives of a rich merchant who wants to set up trade with one of the Dwarf holds on a large scale.;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.52.option1;I think we can come up with something profitable for both of us!;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.53.desc;It seems like the humans were not merchants but instead debt collectors wanting to get their debt paid. You talked to them for a while before excusing yourself.;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.53.option1;I wonder where they are going;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.54.desc;The Dwarfs were an active bunch singing and drinking without any end in sight.;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.54.option1;We are having a great time!;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.55.desc;You easily take part in their festivities with a wide smile on your face and you think that you have become friends with one of them.;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.55.option1;I will never forget this day;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.56.desc;The drunken Dwarfs have challenged you to a drinking competition, will you accept or not?;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.56.option1;Of course I will accept it!;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.56.option2;No, I got to work tomorrow;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.57.desc;You easily out-drink your opponent and claim the price!;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.57.option1;Beer! *belch* I LOVE BEEEEEER!;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.58.desc;Your opponent drinks five flagons in a matter of seconds even though he must have drunk several flagons already.;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.58.option1;And now I have to pay for all of the beer...;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.59.desc;The night at the tavern is finally over so you slowly drag yourself home awaiting the terrible hangover that will soon hit you with the force of a bull.;;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.59.option1;What a night!;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.62.desc;Your beard has now grown so long so that you are no longer seen as a beardling but as a fully grown man. But as a lord so are you expected to enlist in the army, but what regiment will you fight in?;;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.62.option1;The crossbow-armed Quarrellers!;;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.62.option2;The Dwarf warriors!;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.62.option3;The handgun-armed Thunderers!;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.62.option4;Fighting?! Sounds dangerous...;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.63a.desc;The quarrellers are powerful missile troops that use their crossbows to kill the enemy at range. The bolts that the crossbow fires may not have the armour penetration of the handguns but they have a superior range instead which can prove many times even more deadly than the handguns. Fighting in a disciplined manner,firing volley after volley with the high precision that the crossbow is so famous for and so they are righteously feared by their enemies and awed by their allies. You are their lord but they will still not allow you to join their ranks if they consider you unworthy. The training is mostly ceremonial as most Dwarfs that join the quarrellers already know how to use a crossbow but that does not make it any less important to not fail.;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.63b.desc;The Dwarf warriors are the bulk of the Dwarf military might, locked in a hand-to-hand combat with the enemy. Fighting in their famous shieldwall formations, these fierce opponents are close to unstoppable if they manage to keep their formation intact. Every Dwarf warrior uses their own personal armour but most Dwarfs still fight with an axe and shield, and wear a chainmail as well. You are their lord but they will still not allow you to join their ranks if they consider you unworthy. The training is mostly ceremonial as most Dwarfs that join the Dwarf warriors already know how to use an axe but that does not make it any less important to not fail.;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.63c.desc;The thunderers use handguns to kill the enemy with great effect. The bullets can penetrate nearly every set of armour killing a charging chaos warrior in an instant. The thunderers shoot in methodical volleys with the screams of their enemies as a direct result of that. You are their lord but they will still not allow you to join their ranks if they consider you unworthy. The training is mostly ceremonial as most Dwarfs that join the thunderers already know how to use a handgun but that does not make it any less important to not fail.;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.63.option1;Should I be worried?;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.64a.desc;You manage to hit the target in most of your shots and you feel that your initial worry of failing was probably unnecessary.;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.64b.desc;Each and every swing you make with your axe feels so natural, making you believe that your initial worry of getting failed was probably unnecessary.;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.64.option1;What a relief...;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.65.desc;You are utterly hopeless with your weapon and the overseer of the test has at several times sneered at you when he passed by. You won't succeed and you know it.;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.65.option1;I can always hope... right?;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.66a.desc;The final test went very well so you can now call yourself a quarreller!;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.66b.desc;The final test went very well so you can now call yourself a Dwarf warrior!;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.66c.desc;The final test went very well so you can now call yourself a thunderer!;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.66.option1;Well done!;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.67.desc;You failed the final test miserably and you leave the training field in shame.;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.67.option1;I am not worthy of calling myself a Dwarf!;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.68.desc;You are of such a great age so that you can now join the veteran regiments on the battlefield. Few Dwarfs get this honour and you can count yourself lucky to be one of them.;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.68.option1;I will join the longbeards!;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.68.option2;I will join the ironbreakers!;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.69.desc;[Liege.GetTitledName] has bestowed the great honour of being in his hammerer bodyguard to you. Only the best and most seasoned warriors may serve in this elite bodyguard.;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.69.option1;I accept, my liege;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.70a.desc;Your head is not clear enough to serve in the hammerer bodyguard anymore. It may be a wise idea to leave your place vacant so that someone else may join the hammerers instead.;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.70b.desc;Due to your injury you are sadly not able to stay in the hammerer bodyguard anymore.;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.70c.desc;Because of the fact that your liege has thrown you into jail you are not allowed to be in the hammerer bodyguard anymore.;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.70d.desc;Your liege is now a [Liege.PrimaryTitle.GetRulerTitle] and can therefore no longer have a hammerer bodyguard. You are no longer a hammerer.;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.70.option1;Oh no!;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.71.desc;You are no longer a hammerer. Probably due to the fact that the individual you were set to protect no longer is your direct liege.;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.71.option1;Oh no!;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.72.desc;In the midst of battle you suddenly realise that you have pushed the enemy so far back so that you are now in the middle of the enemy army. You turn around and try to fight your way back.;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.72.option1;I guess I better start fighting my way back;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.73.desc;In the midst of battle you notice that one of your enemies has suddenly charged your regiment. He is far away at the moment but he is moving up fast and the others in the regiment haven't seen him.;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.73.option1;You aim your handgun at the enemy.;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.74.desc;Far of into the distance you see one of the enemies creating great havoc among your lines. He is very far away but bringing him down would be a great honour and testimony of your skill.;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.74.option1;You aim your crossbow at the enemy.;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.75a.desc;The best way to improve your fighting skills is to practice, a lot and preferably against real people. Maybe there is someone at your court you could test your fighting skills against?;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.75b.desc;The best way to improve your aim is to practice, a lot and competing with others could help. Maybe there is someone at your court you could test your sharpshooting skills against?;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.75.option1;I guess I better go find someone;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.76a.desc;You found a sparring partner and he was willing to practice his fighting skills against you. It was a close fight and you think he enjoyed it as much as you did.;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.76b.desc;You found a Dwarf and he was willing to practice his aiming skills against you. It was a close match and you think he enjoyed it as much as you did.;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.76.option1;What a day!;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.77.desc;In the midst of battle you suddenly see a Dwarf without an axe duck and weave from one of your enemies. You begin to run as fast as you can towards the Dwarf before it is to late.;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.77.option1;Kazuk!;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.78.desc;Your enemy easily dispatches you of your sword, sending it far away from your grasp. You try to duck and avoid your enemy's deadly swings but it is still just a matter of time before he hits.;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.78.option1;Save me Grimnir!;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.79.desc;Just as the enemy is going to finish off the Dwarf you throw your axe, cleaving its skull in two. You walk forward and see [From.GetTitledName] laying on the ground covered in blood but still alive.;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.79.option1;You can thank me later.;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.80.desc;Just as the enemy is going to finish you off, a sudden blur comes from behind your enemy and the enemy's head gets cleaved in two making the headless body tumble down to the ground.;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.80.option1;Thank you [From.GetTitledName], for saving me!;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.81.desc;You and another Dwarf are humorously bickering about who has shot the most enemies. The competing nature of your relation has made both of you shoot with precision and speed that you could only dream of before.;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.81.option1;We should do that again some time!;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.83.desc;You fight back to back with another longbeard with dead enemies left and right as the result. Few enemies can stand in your way and you feel more alive than ever before!;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.83.option1;KAZUUUUUK!!!;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.85.desc;Your hammer leaves a trail of blood and bones in its wake, leaving no enemies in your path unscathed. Your allies join you in your bloodlust rally with undenied fervor against your enemies.;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.85.option1;Feel my wrath!;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.86.desc;You have joined the table with some old Dwarf veterans and they are all busy boasting about what enemies they have killed and it doesn't take long before you join them in their boasting.;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.86.option1;I am the best fighter ever known!;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.87.desc;You are now old enough to call yourself an adult, leaving your time as a beardling behind you.;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.87.option1;I am free!;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.88a.desc;At the training field you see a Dwarf firing with his crossbow. You can't help yourself from showing your contempt openly and the Dwarf soon sees you and sneezes.;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.88b.desc;At the training field you see a Dwarf firing with his handgun. You can't help yourself from showing your contempt openly and the Dwarf soon sees you and sneezes.;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.88.option1;How can anyone ever want to use that awful weapon?;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.88.option2;It is not worth fighting for;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.89a.desc;In the middle of your aiming practice with your handgun you notice how [From.GetName] contemptuously watches you from afar. You can feel the anger brewing within you.;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.89b.desc;In the middle of your aiming practice with your crossbow you notice how [From.GetName] contemptuously watches you from afar. You can feel the anger brewing within you.;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.89.option1;Idiot;;;;;;;;;x

SJDwarfevents.92.option1;I am in charge of my destiny, not you!;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.94.desc;After your heated discussion a couple of days ago with your son [From.GetFirstName] he has suddenly disapeared without informing anyone about his absence. Has he run away?;;;;;;;;;x
SJDwarfevents.94.option1;Oh oh...;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCDWARF.0;While on a border patrol, a courtier won a great victory against a hostile force. He tore through a number of enemies, like a true Dwarf should!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDWARF.0.b;I could have done just as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDWARF.1;While patrolling, this courtier's troops encountered many enemies of our hold. Instead of standing to fight, he fled and left his brothers to die! He brought shame on his family!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDWARF.1.b;Imprison him! His fate shall be decided later.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDWARF.2;Underneath every Dwarf hold, there are uncountable caves and tunnels, holding forgotten secrets. Will you join the tunnel fighters and explore them?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDWARF.2.a;Time to go tunneling!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDWARF.3;Whatever the cause, you were maimed by forces from below. The tunnelers, seeing you as a threat and a burden, lead you back home. No more tunneling for you.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOPTDWARF.3.a;Ah, well. I brought honour to my clan nonetheless.;;;;;;;;;;;;xx;;;;
EVTDESCDWARF.4;You have been underground for a long time now and amassed great wealth in the meantime. Perhaps it is time to rest for now, before your luck runs out?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDWARF.4.a;Yes, time to go home and see to my wealth...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDWARF.5;Do you wish to stop searching the tunnels, and return to your home?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDWARF.6;While searching the tunnels, your group happens upon an unknown opening in the wall. Do you want to look into it?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDWARF.6.a;We won't get rich as cowards! On we go!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDWARF.7;As you delve into the tunnel, you see some new ore deposits. As proof, you grab some nuggets and mark the location on your map.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDWARF.8;As you delve into the depths, you keep looking for something worthwhile. Suddenly, you hear warning calls from behind - It's a dead end, and a trap! You will have to fight to get out of there!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDWARF.9;Suddenly, wild screams echo through the tunnels. A horde of Night Goblins descends upon your crew! What will you do?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDWARF.9.a;Jump into the fray! There is no honour for cowards!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDWARF.9.b;Better leave that to the professionals...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDWARF.10;You join into the shield wall of the other fighters, and soon the Night Goblins are upon you! Strength and discipline against fury and masses...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDWARF.10.a;For Grimnir, and our Ancestors!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDWARF.11;You are not as experienced as the others, and you are aware of it. You decide to leave these ones to them, and stay behind the shield wall.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDWARF.11.a;Good job, you guys! Let them have it, and get us out of here!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDWARF.12;You and the others fight on, but in the end, there are just too many Goblins. They are EVERYWHERE, and your group tries to fall back...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDWARF.12.a;We have to survive this! Fall back!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDWARF.13;In the end, they are still just Goblins. Your group easily takes down a few dozen, and the rest run for their lives. In the end, you killed most of them!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDWARF.13.a;Hah! That was nothing. You should see me when I'm serious...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDWARF.14;While searching the tunnels, your men come upon an ancient structure of your kin. They are wary of searching it, fearing ambushes or other threats. What will you do?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDWARF.14.a;Go ahead and enter the place myself. We have to find out what this was for!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDWARF.14.b;Leave this be. We do not want to disturb anything.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDWARF.15;You enter the unknown building, but don't recognize anything. Kicking open one door, you find the sarcophagus of another Dwarf. You just desecrated a tomb!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDWARF.16;As you enter the building, you recognize some of the runes on the entrance. And the engravings on the inside. This is an old shrine of Grungni! You immediately begin a prayer, and then search for relics of old to take home, to safety.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDWARF.16.a;We have truly been blessed by him!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDWARF.17;You have been wounded, and can no longer carry on searching the tunnels with the others. It is time to return home.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

dwarfunification0desc;You have taken some time to look at things, and realized that the High Kingdom needs a new push to reunite. You're both known and renowned enough to give that push and be elected by a council of kings as the new High king. Will you call the others to your court?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dwarfunification0A;Yes, the time has come!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dwarfunification0B;No, things are fine right now!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dwarfunification1desc;The messengers quickly reach every hold that the Dwarfs still maintain - A Hold King called for a Council of Kings, something not done in centuries, to elect a new, proper High King. The other kings at least humour the meeting, it seems.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dwarfunification2desc;This Dwarf, renowned and powerful from what you heard, has called a Council of Kings and declared his High Kingship true and the old line powerless. Do you assist this claimant?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dwarfunification2A;Yes, let the holds stand united once more!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dwarfunification2B;No, I'll never accept this beardling as my King!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dwarfunification3desc;You have sworn to serve the new High King, and therefore, the old kingship is of no importance anymore.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dwarfunification4desc;My High King, I declare your word as truthful and accept your declaration of High Kingship. Let Karak Ankor reunite and the enemies of our clans tremble!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dwarfunification4A;Well said. Have an Ale, and slay the Greenskins!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dwarfunification5desc;You declare your unwillingness to serve a usurper High King, but many of your clan aren't entirely with you on that...;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTADR_dwarfs.30;So be it!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDR_dwarfs.50_alive_dwarf;That cursed grobi-kin, [From.GetBestName] has attempted a dishonourable plot against you. This is an offense Clan [Root.GetOnlyDynastyName] won't forget or forgive, and so, a new Grudge is written in [Root.Capital.GetName]'s Book of Grudges...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDR_dwarfs.50_dead_dwarf_relativef;That cursed grobi-kin, [Root.grudge_killer.GetBestName] has murdered [From.GetBestName], one of your kin, surely through most dishonourable means. This is an offense Clan [Root.GetOnlyDynastyName] won't forget or forgive, and so, a new Grudge is written in [Root.Capital.GetName]'s Book of Grudges...;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCDR_dwarfs.104;[From.GetFullName], a Slayer, has arrived in [From.Location.GetName]. Whether he is just passing through or searching for beasts to slay is unknown. Better keep an eye on him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_dwarfs.53;It's what must be done...;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_dwarfs.53;No! There's no need for that;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDR_dwarfs.59;By [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName], justice is served! You have honoured Clan [Root.GetOnlyDynastyName] and its ancestors by avenging the pending Grudge against the kruti [From.GetBestName].

dwarf_government_desc;"The Dwarfs base their feudal-like government upon millennia-old traditions. Usually, Dwarf rulers ""lease"" lands to their subjects, as well as the clan halls, forges, and mines in them. In turn, the subjects must provide back a proportion of all gold and precious minerals extracted from the leased lands, and a levy is placed upon their holds. The Dwarfs are highly isolationist and bear little love for surface-dwellers, but they maintain great respect towards their own.";;;;;;;;;;;;;
