lahmian_queen;Queen of the Lahmias;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmian_queen_desc;The Lahmians are a breed of schemers and indolent hedonists who seek to reconquer their ancient city of Lahmia.

# LAHMIAN EVENTS
#
lahmia0desc;You are the Queen of the Lahmians. Your ancient kingdom of Lahmia in Nehekhara was taken from you, but its glories of old can still be restored. Using stealth, cunning, and seduction you can mould the world of men to serve your purposes. Send your daughters into the world, have them infiltrate the corridors of power, and when the time is right - have your mortal puppets dance to the tune that you play for them. Seduce the weak mortals to become your slaves and then one day you shall lead a great army to retake Lahmia and you shall live forever as its queen, with nothing in the world being denied to you.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia0A;So let it be written, so let it be done!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia1desc;You have decided to seduce this target personally. He will have no choice but to ultimately become your slave, and do all that you require of him...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia1A;I'll need to pack... slaves! Ready my baggage-train!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia5desc;You have chosen this man to focus your efforts on. You will have to send one of your dynasty to accomplish the task, only they are skilled enough to even attempt to seduce a powerful man like this. (Note: Wait a week between each assignment);;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia5A;I will send this one;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia5B;I will send an elite member of the Sisterhood;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia6desc;Your mother has instructed you to seduce a target, and bend him to the will of the Sisterhood. You must leave immediately.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia6A;I shall pack my best outfits, perfumes, and jewels immediately, my Queen.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia8desc;You are in the lands of your target. Now... what shall we do...;;;;;;;;;;;;x ;
lahmia8A;I will play the damsel in distress...;;;;;;;;;;;;x ;
lahmia8B;I will host a lavish ball, as the rich new heiress in town;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia8C;With his wife dead, he will need some comforting...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia8D;I will host a lavish ball, as the rich new heiress in town;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia9desc;Your daughter sends word - she has reached her destination safely, and will begin infiltrating the court as ordered and bend its ruler to your will.;;;;;;;;;;;;x ;
lahmia9A;Mmm... good.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia10desc;One morning while falconing, you hear a lady scream in the distance. She sounds like she is in serious trouble! You look around, and your companions are nowhere to be seen. What do you do?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia10A;I shall rescue the lady!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia10B;If she's in trouble, I could be in danger. Ride for home at once!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia11desc;You hear your target is going falconing, and have had your handmaidens ensure that his companions would be... distracted. Once you see him alone in the distance, you give the signal, and three hired ruffians pretend to attack you as you let out an ear-piercing scream of terror! Just as expected, your target comes riding full force with his sword drawn just when the ruffians throw you to the ground. Seeing him, they scatter in all directions, and he jumps off his horse, asking if you are unhurt.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia11A;Oh, my brave lord! You saved my life!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia12desc;You hear your target is going falconing, and have had your handmaidens ensure that his companions would be... distracted. Once you see him alone in the distance, you give the signal, and three hired ruffians pretend to attack you as you let out an ear-piercing scream of terror! You see your intended staring, hesitating, even as the ruffians throw you to the ground and act like they are about to take you. Then the coward turns and rides away at full speed! Useless, weak, and thrice-cursed mortal fool!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia12A;*hiss* I'll need time to come up with a new plan...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia13desc;As you rush towards them with your sword drawn, the ruffians quickly scatter. The lady is beautiful, and judging from her torn clothes and jewels, very rich. She thanks you profusely, and you escort her back to the city. Upon arrival she takes her leave, but promises that she will repay you for your gallantry.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia13A;What a stunning beauty. I'm a hero for saving her!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BANQUET;A Great Ball;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia14desc;You play the part of the noble damsel in distress perfectly, allowing him to see himself as your saviour and protector as he escorts you back to the city. Upon arriving at the market, you take your leave, but promise to reward him for his virtue.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia14A;Now I will invite him to a ball...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia14B;I should get rid of his wife first...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia14C;I'll sneak into his room at night...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia14D;Unfortunately, this game ends. I must return home.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia15desc;Word around the city is that a rich heiress is hosting a magnificent gala, and of course your invitation arrived just this morning in gold-stamped letters. Rumours say that she is as beautiful as she is rich. Do you want to attend?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia15A;Why yes, of course! Next Friday? Certainly.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia15B;Oh, it's the lady I saved while falconing! Of course I'll attend.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia15C;No, I have no interest in balls or heiresses;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia16desc;Tonight is the night of the ball you are hosting. Everything has been prepared to an exquisite detail, and you are the centre of attention and envy in the room. Finally, your prize guest arrives and the evening proceeds down to the minutest detail of your desires. The music is playing, the nobles are dancing, and the wine flows. You dance with your guest of honour, and work your arts of seduction on him subtly. As the evening draws to a close, it is time to make your move...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia16A;Whisper in his ear and suggest he stay the night.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia16B;Poison his wife, his grief will make him vulnerable.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia17desc;Tonight is the night of the grand gala. You arrive to a splendid mansion and are greeted by the beautiful - and obviously fabulously wealthy - heiress. As the wine flows and the music plays, you find your eyes inexplicably drawn towards her, and you often find her smiling seductively back at you from across the room. As the evening draws to a close, the last dance is called, and she glides over and takes you to the floor. After a flawlessly executed dance, she whispers hotly in your ear 'Care to stay the night, my lord?';;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia17A;*whisper back* I'll return when the guests have left...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia17B;But... I'm married! I can't!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia17C;No, that would not be proper, my lady. Good night.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LAHMIA_LOVERS;Lovers;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LAHMIA_SEDUCTION;Seduction;;;;;;;;;;;;x
GRIEF;Grief;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia18descA;You seduce your target into a night of wild passion, and as dawn is about to break, you know that for the moment at least - he is under your spell. While he remains so, you can use your influence once a year to get him to send you expensive gifts, or even troops on some pretext that your distant family lands are under threat from greenskins or even other vampires. Should you leave him to return to your own lands, however, your hold over him will be lost.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia18descB;You seduce your target into a night of wild passion, and as dawn is about to break, you know that for the moment at least - he is under your spell. While he remains so, you can use your influence once a year to get him to send you expensive gifts, or even troops on some pretext that your distant family lands are under threat from greenskins or even other vampires. You will then pass these on to your queen, to further the cause of restoring ancient Lahmia to the sisterhood. Should you leave him to return to your own lands, however, your hold over him will be lost.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia18A;I knew he would not resist me.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia19desc;You have spent a night of wild passion with this beautiful and mysterious lady, and you are certain that you'll be seeing more of her in the months and years to come. You have scratch and bite marks all over your body, and though it hurts to get dressed, you leave with a smile on your face.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia19A;Until next time, mysterious lady.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia21desc;Cruel fate! Your wife suddenly took ill, and died screaming in the night. It happened so soon... but the doctors could find no trace of poison, and who would have any motive?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia21A;Why, gods, why?!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia21B;These are perilous times...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia22desc;Hah! The mark's wife died 'suddenly and tragically'... what a shame... and from my spies in the court, no one knows why. Those servant boys I seduced did very well indeed. That's one obstacle removed. Now... to proceed with the plan...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia22A;Yes, what shall be the next step?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia23desc;A plot to poison your wife has been revealed! When put to the question, the servants who were caught with the poison revealed everything - a beautiful rich heiress seduced them to do the dark deed...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia23A;I want this 'heiress' seized and executed!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia24desc;Damnations! Those foolish servant boys you seduced got themselves caught trying to poison your target's wife, and your sources in the court say that they spoke your name. This cat and mouse game is over. Time to flee.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia24A;I only hope my mistress will forgive my failure.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia24B;I can't believe I failed...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia26desc;Cruel fate! As you wake up the next day, your wife lies dead next to you. It happened so soon and so quietly... but the doctors could find no trace of poison, and who would have any motive?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia26A;Curses! Why gods, why?!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia26B;These are perilous times...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia27desc;You manage to dump poison from your ring into the cup of your target's wife, just as the final toast is made. From reports, she died quietly in her sleep in the night, and the cause remains a mystery. That's one obstacle removed. Now... to proceed with the plan...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia27A;Yes, what shall be the next step?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia28desc;Your wife has been poisoned, but due to the quick actions of a priest she was saved in time! It must have happened during the feast...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia28A;I want all who attended questioned immediately!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia29desc;Damnations! Your sources inside the court reveal to you that the place is in an uproar. Her life was saved by a holy priest, but they are going to conduct a thorough investigation of everyone who attended the feast. As a vampire, you cannot pass such close examination... This cat and mouse game is over. Time to flee.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia29A;I only hope my mistress will forgive my failure.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia29B;I can't believe I failed...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia30desc;The shock of your wife's death still haunts you, but your new lady acquaintance has been a great help and comfort. You find yourself thinking about her all the time. Perhaps, it would not be wrong to let this go a little further?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia30A;Yes, surely it was meant to be!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia30B;No. There is something 'off' about her...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia31desc;You have played the role of a trusted friend to your mark since his wife's death, and one night after a lot of wine he moves in to kiss you. Hah - your skills of seduction are as strong as ever, he never had a chance...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia31A;All men are weak, if you only know which buttons to push.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia32desc;Despite trying your best to seduce your mark, it seems you have failed! He is no longer answering your letters, and the guards at the gates will not admit you to his presence any more. It seems you must return home and give up on this chase...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia32A;Curses;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia33desc;Your mark refuses to take the bait, and has sent word that he will not attend your ball. Your attempts to get in further contact with him have all failed. It seems you must give up on this chase... it's time to return home.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia33A;Curses!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia34desc;Your mark looks at you with shock when you offer him to stay the night, and coldly informs you that that would not be proper. He leaves in a hurry, and all attempts at further contact fails. It seems this chase is over... it's time to return home.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia34A;Curses!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmiadeadtarget;Your mark is dead. It's time to go home.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia50desc;You have continued to infiltrate the layers of high society around your mark, hosting lavish midnight balls and creating your own network of spies where your handmaidens manipulate and seduce the lesser actors in this game while you set the tune to which they dance. Your mark is in the palm of your hand, he will not refuse you anything. What shall you ask for? Perhaps your funds are tied up in a business venture and you need some gold to maintain your lifestyle? Or perhaps your dear fictional friend or relative has lands under threat, and could use some soldiers to help her out?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia50C;I must return home.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia50A;Manipulate him into giving you gold;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia50B;Manipulate him into giving you troops;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia51desc;While attending one of her lavish midnight balls, your dear friend, looking stunning as ever, asks to speak to you privately. She looks distraught and on the verge of tears. It seems her steward has tied her money up in a risky business venture, and she fears she cannot maintain her estate at all if she cannot find the funds elsewhere. She would be humiliated, thrown out of her home, and forced to live like a commoner. She looks at you appealingly, and asks if you can do anything to help her out of her predicament?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia51A;My dear lady, let it trouble you no longer. I will help.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia51B;No, I won't help with money.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia52desc;Your benefactor agrees to support your lifestyle with his own funds until yours are once more liquid, and you make sure he is well rewarded for his generosity.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia52A;This game continues to delight! Now I'll send these to my queen.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia52B;This game continues to delight!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia53desc;Your dear lady friend is delighted, and you are richly rewarded for your generosity over the coming days and weeks. You are pleased with yourself, as the city would be such a dull place without her stunning beauty, lavish parties and clever wit. She really is the centre of high society in many ways.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia53A;I couldn't let such a noble lady live like a commoner...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia54desc;Curses! Your mark is apparently not so easily manipulated... he refuses to help you with money, which makes him useless to you. All this work wasted... it is time to return home.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia54A;That arrogant mortal, I should rip his throat out...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia55desc;You refuse to help out the heiress with money, and despite her pleas, you leave the ball without helping her. The next day, you are informed that she has packed up and left the city.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia55A;Shame. I think I'll miss her.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia56desc;While attending one of her lavish balls, your dear friend, looking stunning as ever, asks to speak to you privately. She looks distraught and on the verge of tears. It seems a dear elderly aunt has lands that are under threat, and she doesn't know what to do to help. She looks at you appealingly, and asks that if you are powerful enough to send some troops to her aid?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia56A;I will outfit an expedition immediately to clear her lands!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia56B;No, I won't help with troops.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia57desc;Your benefactor agrees to send troops to your endangered relative, and you make sure he is well rewarded for his generosity.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia57A;This game continues to delight! Now I'll send these to my queen.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia57B;This game continues to delight!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia58desc;Your dear lady friend is delighted, and you are richly rewarded for your generosity over the coming days and weeks. You are pleased with yourself, as the city would be such a dull place without her stunning beauty, lavish parties and clever wit. She really is the centre of high society in many ways.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia58A;I couldn't let such a noble lady be distraught;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia59desc;Curses! Your mark is apparently not so easily manipulated... he refuses to help you with troops, which makes him useless to you. All this work wasted... it is time to return home.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia59A;That arrogant mortal, I should rip his throat out...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia60desc;You refuse to help out the heiress with troops, and despite her pleas, you leave the ball without helping her. The next day, you are informed that she has packed up and left the city.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia60A;Shame. I think I'll miss her.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia100desc;My Queen, I have failed you. The mark resisted attempts at seduction, and would be of no help in gaining us either gold or troops.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia100A;Failure is not an option, my dear...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia100B;You disappoint me, dear daughter;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia101desc;My Queen, the mark has died. There is nothing more for me to do here... I shall return home immediately.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia101A;These mortals... such frail and brief lives...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia102desc;My Queen, I send you these gifts. I succeeded in manipulating my mark into giving me some gold to maintain my lifestyle.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia102A;Well done, daughter.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia102B;Well done, daughter. Return home when you are able.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia103desc;My Queen, I send you these troops. I succeeded in manipulating my mark into giving me some to protect my dear elderly relative... I trust you will soon have them turned into loyal servants of the sisterhood shortly after they arrive.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia103A;Well done, daughter. We look forward to breaking them in.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia103B;Well done, daughter. Return home when you are able.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia200desc;One night alone with your lover she smiles darkly at you, revealing sharp fangs, and grasps you with supernatural strength to prevent you from running. She is a vampire! Who could have possibly predicted this turn of events? She wants you to come with her to the Lahmian Court, where you may be granted life eternal, and great power... do you dare refuse?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia200A;Never!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia200B;Eternal life and power you say? Why of course, my love...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia202desc;One night alone with your mortal plaything you smile darkly at him, revealing sharp fangs, and pin him down to prevent him from running. You ask him to join you at the Lahmian Court, where he may be granted life eternal, and great power... after the shock subsides, you see that he will do as instructed. The promise of power and an eternity of delights has swayed his weak mind, and you can now do with him as you wish. His bizarre disappearance means he is disinherited from his family forever now, but if he has any claims, you can press them forcefully in war if you so desire.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia202A;Excellent...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia203desc;One night alone with your mortal plaything you smile darkly at him, revealing sharp fangs, and pin him down to prevent him from running. You ask him to join you at the Lahmian Court, where he may be granted life eternal, and great power... after the shock subsides, you see that he will not do as instructed. He tries to pull away from you and screams for the guards - what do you do?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia203A;Attack him!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia203B;*hiss* Weak fool! *jump out the window and make a run for it*;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia204desc;You think you have found a mark... she is reputedly both beautiful and highly skilled in the arts of intrigue. She might make a fine addition to the sisterhood. Shall you seek her out?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia204A;Yes, by all means;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia205desc;doesnt really matter, only for unlanded AIs. But she gets the offer to join the lahmians, thats the gist;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia205A;Yes;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia205B;No;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia206desc;Through a mixture of seduction, intimidation, and just perfectly set up circumstances, you convince your mark to accept the blood kiss and join the Lahmian sisterhood. Your queen will be very pleased...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia207desc;Despite your best efforts, you fail at getting close enough to your mark to give her the blood kiss. Curses! All that time wasted... but she was too well guarded, there was no sense in risking your life just to turn her.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia207A;There will be other marks...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia208desc;Your [GetFromRelation] has run off it seems, leaving her home and family. Why would she do something like this, what could have possibly enticed her to give up everything she had?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia208A;Scandalous... she is cut off!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia208B;Poor girl, she had so much potential.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia209desc;One day you wake up alone, with a note on your wife's pillow. It coldly informs you that she is leaving you, and that she does not want you to look for her or think of her any more. 'All we have is dead, as I am dead. Marry another.', it ends with.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia209A;Thrice cursed harlot! She has humiliated me!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia210desc;My Queen, I have sired a new Lahmian progeny. She is both beautiful and highly skilled. I trust that she will make us proud, and serve the sisterhood well.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia210A;Well done. You are a good minion.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia302desc;One of your holdings in the realms of men has sent you their bi-annual profits. Whether from prostitution, blackmail, assassinations or simple corrupt business deals, they have managed to turn a tidy profit it seems.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia302A;Well done, sisters.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia302B;Do not bother me with this again. Just send the cash.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia303desc;There have been strange things happening in this province. The temple suspects a hidden group of vampires, and these must be rooted out with fire and sword.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia303A;Our faith will prevail!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia303B;No, it's probably nothing...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia304desc;You have survived the efforts of the vampires to stop you, and now that you know they are here, the infestation is rooted out with fire, stakes, and cold silver.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia304A;Our faith prevails again!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia305desc;One of your holdings has been destroyed by the Witch Hunters. Perhaps it is time to appoint some better protectors? It is their job to prevent these things from happening!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia305A;Curses!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lahmia305B;Do not bother me with such bad news again!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
witchhunter40desc;Your top liege is a servant of the gods, and will not tolerate you in his realm. It is better to flee now, rather than to risk destruction at the hands of the Witch Hunters...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
witchhunter40A;Agreed, I must leave at once!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BRseduction0desc;A foolish mortal has tried to seduce you. It was entertaining for a while, but as your desire grows, so does your hunger. One night you can barely restrain yourself from taking your fill of their blood - perhaps it is time to end this little game?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BRseduction0A;Yes, I must sate my thirst! *attack your lover*;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BRseduction0B;No, I will show restraint...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BRseduction1desc;You have foolishly decided to take a vampire for your lover. One night, as the passion runs high, a feral look comes over your lover. Sharp fangs snap out and clawed hands hold you down with bestial strength - then all you feel is pain as you are brutally mauled and drained of blood.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BRseduction1A;Oh gods, wait! Nooo - not there!!! Get off me!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BRseduction2desc;You have foolishly decided to take a vampire for your lover. One night, as the passion runs high, a feral look comes over your lover. Sharp fangs snap out and clawed hands hold you down with supernatural strength - then your lover smiles down at you, satisfied for the moment. 'No, you get to live another night...';;;;;;;;;;;;x
BRseduction2A;That's it - I'm done with this vampire!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BRseduction2B;You had me worried there for a second...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BRseduction3desc;You feed greedily on your lover, but at the last moment, show some restraint. The pulse is weak, the body is mauled, but somehow, still breathing. You decide to let them live, if they can recover, and tell your minions to take this one back home in their carriage.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BRseduction3A;No sense completely draining good cattle, I always say.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BRseduction4desc;A non-believer has tried to seduce you. It was entertaining for a while, but the more time passes, the more you want them to embrace the true powers of the void. Perhaps it is time to bestow some of grandfather Nurgle's gifts on them?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BRseduction4A;Yes, feel the embrace of Grandfather Nurgle, my love...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BRseduction4B;No, I will show restraint...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BRseduction5desc;You have foolishly decided to take a follower of the Ruinous Powers for your lover. One morning you wake up feeling dizzy and nauseous, and your paramour smiles down at you. 'I have given you a gift... do you like it?';;;;;;;;;;;;x
BRseduction5A;*coughs up blood* That's it - we are DONE!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BRseduction5B;I... I do kind of like it...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BRseduction6desc;A non-believer has tried to seduce you. It was entertaining for a while, but the more time passes, the more you want them to embrace the true powers of the void. Perhaps it is time to show them some of the true pleasures that Slaanesh has to offer?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BRseduction6A;Yes, feel the embrace of Slaanesh, lover...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BRseduction7desc;You have foolishly decided to take a follower of the Ruinous Powers for your lover. One morning you wake up, and as your body burns with pain, you realize that last night was not a nightmare. You are covered in wounds and as you remember tortured fragments of last night's events your lover merely smiles down at you. 'Did you enjoy it, my love?';;;;;;;;;;;;x
BRseduction7A;That's it, we are DONE!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BRseduction7B;I... I think I did...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BRseduction8desc;A non-believer has tried to seduce you. It was entertaining for a while, but the more time passes, the more you want them to embrace the true powers of the void. Perhaps it is time to see if they are worthy of the Blood God's favour?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BRseduction8A;Yes, a test is in order.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BRseduction9desc;You have foolishly decided to take a follower of the Ruinous Powers for your lover. One day while walking in the woods with your lover, a huge knight approaches, radiating a palpable aura of evil. Your lover smiles. 'Today is the day you must prove yourself to Khorne, my love...";;;;;;;;;;;;x
BRseduction9A;That's it, we are DONE! *run away as fast as possible*;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BRseduction9B;Yes... at last. Blood for the Blood God!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BRseduction10desc;A non-believer has tried to seduce you. It was entertaining for a while, but the more time passes, the more you want them to embrace the true powers of the void. Perhaps it is time to see how they deal with the Tzeentch's gifts?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BRseduction10A;Yes, some warpdust in their wine perhaps...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BRseduction11desc;You have foolishly decided to take a follower of the Ruinous Powers for your lover. One night after drinking some strange-tasting wine, you wake in the middle of the night to terrible pain as your body transforms. Your lover smiles down at you - 'Do not be afraid, this is a gift, a wonderful, wonderful gift...';;;;;;;;;;;;x
BRseduction11A;*scream in horror as you feel the mutation* That's it, we are DONE!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BRseduction11B;I... I will embrace the change!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BRseduction3B;No, our passion shall be eternal!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
