- Adds in decisions to buy a black dragon egg, hatch it and eat it.
- Added in missing black dragon hatchling artifact so that Black Dragon events function.
- Malekiths armour is now cursed so he cannot remove it
- Malekith no longer spawns with a Wyvern.
- Added in an offmap system for each of the four chaos gods, this is fully featured and is how you recieve boons from the gods! Im not going to go into detail here as I want you to explore the system for yourselves
- Added in an Warband(Warrior Lodge) system for each of the four chaos gods and undivided, this is fully featured and is another way to recieve boons from the gods! Im not going to go into detail here as I want you to explore the system for yourselves

- Remove/fix references to the elixir_of_youth trait, its an artifact now
- Allow pillaging provinces with only 1 settlement
- Minor QoL on establish_lahmian_presence decision
- Updated fimir shearl to be unable to inherit or hold titles
- Females that follow slaanesh no longer have the option to go celibate
- Allowed Southlanders  to tell a story (african flavor from HF)
- Allowed decision "hold a grand hunt" for cadai and cythari elves group, and allowed females
- Humans are more likely to support magic when doom is high and less likely when it’s low
- Expelling the witch Hunters will make magic de facto legal and will make witches and hedge wizards start appearing in the realm
- Realms ruled by peasant leaders and by those who have expelled the Witch Hunters will have a much higher chance of spawning mages if magic is not legal elsewhere in the old world
- Split magic laws out into their own triggers and effects files
- Doom counter can no longer go negative or over 1000 and should start properly.
    (Now triggers off Malekith on game start and then is set as a repeating event on province 1 every year)
- Doom can now passively increase per the amount of Champions, Chosen and Princes active in the world as well as if the Everchosen is active
    This is a random chance and is lower if they only hold land in the chaos wastes and massively lower if they are not landed
    Higher traits have a higher base chance of adding doom.
    However the doom loss on death has been extended to champions as well, though at a much lower level
- Higher Doom makes mages much more likely to appear randomly (even higher for chaos mages) and also allows easier summoning of Demons
- Magic System
    Moved all triggers and scripted effects used in the new casting system to new appropriately named files, everything outside these files is currently deprecated except for magic crafting and learning events
    Rewrote magic xp system to make sense (Why the hell was it using three xp variables rather a single xp variable?)
- Magic xp is gained during casting in battle and passively through a random event
- Higher Magic potential traits make it easier for you to level up your magic power level
- Added a bunch of tooltips to magic triggers
- Liche priests and tomb kings get a 1 and 2 magic pool boost respectively, otherwise they might not be able to cast with a low magic power. Liche priests are incapable of levelling up magic xp anyway so not that overpowered
- Wearing armour as a mage can reduce battle magic pool if not using specific mage equipment
- Gave orcs and goblins a chance to spawn with magic
- Also made non historical characters on game start have a chance to be mages not just those generated as the game continues to make each game different
    Average of about 6 High Elf mages, 2-3 dark elf mages, 5 chaos mages etc.
- Changed time for expelled_strigany modifier to expire after 10 years
- Magic system extended to sieges
    On a siege starting it will check all attacking commanders in the army and apply a scaling province modifier that reduces fort level, garrison size and levy reinforce rate depending on the total magic power present in the attacking force.
    A tutorial event will pop up first time it happens for the player same as battle magic

- Gave Dwarfs the mountain_ambush_tactic Combat Tactic
- Added special combat tactics for the chaos warbands when experiencing a call to glory
- Fixed the ai Everchosen spawn events
- Added Black Crusades
    -Black Crusades can be started by the Everchosen, or an undivided ruler with enough prestige and piety can start one by decision if no Everchosen exists and there is a moderate level of doom
    -Other chaos religions (except chaos dwarfs) and Norscans with a dark patron can join in after the war starts for a chance at artefacts and favour if chaos wins
    -However they will not receive any land or war chest rewards due to hardcoded limitations in the crusade system.
    -Otherwise functions mostly the same as base game crusades with events, bloodline, traits, and GFX made more suited to chaos
- Broad priority for targeting is
    > Kislev (Volkova then Kislev Kingdom)/ the Watchtowers
    > Empire Coastal
    > Empire interior/ other parts of Naggaroth/Norse dwarfs
    > Brettonia/Ulthuan/Estalia

- Fixed save bricking crash with old amazon event causing wh_setup.7 to keep trying to fix a character religion in an infinite loop.

- Von Carstein Vampire War Events should now check held titles before firing
- Beastmen Duels for rulership are now deadly
- Added a offmap boon to become a chaos undivided champion as undivided could not become the other champion types
    and the only other way was through the warbands
- Ai will now use all boons, and request them in a more intelligent way e.g. will only summon one daemon familiar of each type, won’t claim more than 1 steed etc.
- Made it so when the ai event to make them join a Warband fires it will prioritize rulers joining, basic daemons, bloodletters, plague lords are now forbidden from joining. As well as rulers e.g. mercs who don’t hold actual land

- Chaos Undivided can use the steeds from the offmaps

- Fixed issue with Fimir born from human mothers not getting Fimir portraits
- Slavery menu now works for selling slaves
- Magic revolts will no longer pick an imprisoned person to be the leader

- The Lizardmen War to reclaim the staff of jade has been added, the empire of lustria has to be formed first, and then Mazdamundi will awaken to lead the lizardmen against the Bretonnian Crusade City of Antoch

- Fix to Drakenhof starting with a city as the capital and fixed the drakenhof unique buildings

- Disinherited Neferatas and Ushorans brother and his children so if they die we dont end up with a random tomb king in the badlands/mountains

- Merged Malekith death and overthrown empire destruction event. Now when Malekith loses his empire or dies e_naggaroth is destroyed
- If Malekith held e_ulthuan as well and the the heir to e_naggaroth gets both empires and is not in the asur_group then e_ulthuan is destroyed as well

- Added chaos cult sleeper agents:
    The ai can attempt to recruit even when the society has reached the max membership limit, if they succeed in the event chain the recruited target will not join the full society
    and instead simply change secret religion and be flagged a sleeper agent

    Every 5 years the sleeper agents will check if the society has dipped in membership below the limit and join automatically if it has, when a general cultist uprising happens
    any sleeper agents will convert, leave any non chaos societies and join in alongside the normal society members

    People the player recruit will always join the society bypassing the limit same as before.
    rank 3 members of the cult can now also declare an uprising, as the cults are global and members in realms other than the single rank 4 member were essentially useless
    the ai will not currently declare an uprising if the player is in the same realm as a rank 3 or 4 member

------------------------------------------------------
FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
------------------------------------------------------
```
Q: Are you going to add anything from the Age of Sigmar/The End Times?
A: Short answer: No. I have plenty of work overhauling the current bookmark for now.
```
```
Q: Why can't I play a Half-Elf/Half-Dwarf/Half-Orc/other hybrid character?
A: Because they don't exist in Warhammer. Humans, Elves, Dwarfs, Orcs, Lizardmen etc. are not biologically compatible. If you take an Elf/Dwarf/etc. as a lover or concubine, any pregnancies will only result in stillbirths, and that's only because the game engine won't let us completely prevent interbreeding.
```
```
Q: I'm having trouble with the Ruler Designer!
A: The Ruler Designer is not explicitly supported for Warhammer: Geheimnisnacht. We've done some work to fix its worst problems but it is still unbalanced and incomplete. Use at your own risk.
```
```
Q: I understand you don't support the Ruler Designer, but how do I get around the problems?
A: Use the admin console to add your race trait if it doesn't appear after a few months of in-game time. This can help you avert several issues like the marriage, divorce and miscarriage bug, the lack of long life as an elf or dwarf, the lack of immortality as a vampire or Tomb King, and so on. Most of the time when we get a report of an issue with the Ruler Designer, it's because of race trait issues. Don't add your race trait in the RD itself - due to a hardcoded issue, it causes some traits (like any with the Immortal tag) to not function properly.
```
```
Q: What DLCs do I need to play this mod?
A: You can play Warhammer: Geheimnisnacht with nothing but the most barebones basic version of Crusader Kings 2 with absolutely none of the DLC activated except for Charlemagne which is required for our 3-D models. However, all major DLCs are highly recommended, as they are either needed for race mechanics or to fully enhance the experience. Most importantly: Horse Lords - Many races, such as Blood Dragon Vampires and High Elfs use HL mechanics Legacy of Rome - Many powerful retinues that balance certain races are contained here The Republic - There are many different merchant republics scattered across the globe The Old Gods - Norse flavour and events for the Norscans and Kislevite pagans Jade Dragon - off-map Powers for Cathay and the Chaos Gods Holy Fury - Bloodlines, warrior lodges and More! No music, unit, or portrait packs are needed, as Geheimnisnacht uses its own music composed by Steve Gernes, custom 3-D models, and handmade portraits made by Silfae.
```
```
Q: How do I learn/use magic?
A: The Magic system is one of the big systems in need of a rebuild. In its current state, I'm not sure what works and what doesn't. Hopefully, I can finish it soon.
```
```
Q: Why can't Khornates or Blood Dragons learn magic?
A: Lore restriction, Khornates and Blood Dragons do not use or learn magic under any circumstances. This also means that it **won't** be implemented. Sorry, that's just how the lore works.
```
```
Q: Why is the Empire not unified?
A: Warhammer: Geheimnisnacht begins in IC 2010, over five centuries before the reign of Karl Franz and the familiar events of recent Warhammer canon such as Total War: Warhammer, the Storm of Chaos campaign, the End Times, etc. Three centuries before Magnus the Pious reunited the Empire in 2304 the Empire was in a state of civil war, as multiple Electors fought over the Imperial throne - and on the night of Geheimnisnacht in 2010, the day the mod begins, Vlad von Carstein of Sylvania revealed himself as a vampire and threw his hat into the ring by summoning a great undead host. This date was chosen because the divisions and events taking place at the time made for better gameplay than the more unified and - so to speak - more stable Warhammer world of the 2500s. Imagine trying to play a campaign when almost every faction is one giant blob!
```
```
Q: Are you going to expand the map to Cathay?
A: Short answer: No. Long answer: Very little information exists on Cathay, Ind, Nippon and the rest of the lands beyond the Mountains of Mourn in the Warhammer setting. We have nothing to work with, no idea how to properly put their factions together, what mechanics to give them, nothing. Not to mention that the game is already rather laggy with the current world map - expanding the map further and adding at least three new major kingdoms, not to mention all the other factions we'd have to put in, would likely make Geheimnisnacht unplayable on all but the strongest computers. We have, however, compromised and added some Cathayans to a colony in the Southlands. And with Jade Dragon introducing off-map powers we have begun work on representing Cathay in some way.
```
```
Q: Is there any End Times-style content? Like the world ending?
A: Something to that effect is planned, absolutely, but not yet fully implemented.
```
```
Q: I got killed by a Halfling in a minor skirmish!
A: Such is life in CK2, consider hiding in your keep if you're afraid of death.
```
```
Q: I want to help out! How can I join the Geheimnisnacht team?
A: It's as easy as making something we can implement into the mod! Put together an event, some code, a guide, etc. and contact @Komioski, the current developer, or ping him in #general-discussion. If your content works, fits the setting and lore and doesn't possess our computers with daemons from the Chaos Realm, you will likely be recruited to the team! ...If it breaks everything, melts our PCs, overpowers the game or contains Warcraft references, you will likely not be recruited to the team. Please test your work before sending it to us, exorcising our offices and computers and replacing devoured team members can seriously delay work on updates.
```
```
Q: Is this mod dead? Why haven't I heard any news in a while?
A: Be Patient, I have a Development Plan/Roadmap, and I'm constantly active if you haven't heard anything it means I'm working hard on the next update! Trust me, you'll be informed if we ever stop development.
```
```
Q: Are there any plans to create a mod for CK3?
A: Yes we plan to look into the viability of such a thing upon release in September, we will let you know when we have something to share.
```
```
Q: How do I become a tester/Lab Rat? What's the point?
A: Anyone who meets the requirements (over 100hrs of playtime, all DLCs, and lore knowledge) can join the lab rat program. We recruit in waves and the #admissions channel opens with little warning but if you manage to make it in it can be a lot of fun! Perks include exclusive sub-mods, access to Dev versions, multiplayer games with the Dev, and a chance to earn a seat on the Council of Thirteen. An exclusive group of contributors with some power over development.
```
```
Q: Does this mod accept donations or have a Patreon?
A: Nothing official at the moment, I have a Patreon for my game development projects but it's not linked to this project at this time. Perhaps in the future.
```
```
Q: What is WH: Geheimnisnacht - Legacy?
A: With the recent worldwide pandemic this year, development was put on hiatus for a few months as I adjusted to working from home. This meant that my initial planned release window of summer for the main branch of the mod would have to be pushed back, making it more than 2 years since a public version has been made available to the community. Therefore I decided to set aside some time to rework a personal project of one of our Lab Rats @manuswag, which compiled the old 1.2 version of Geheimnisnacht with my current development version into a "playable" (it didn't CTD at least) version of the mod compatible with CK2 v3.3.3. I spent a week recruiting a host of new Lab Rats and put them to work rooting out the most obvious/game-breaking bugs most of which I managed to fix. The released version is Technically Unsupported and may or may not receive future development (though there is a #critical-bug-report channel for any game-breaking bugs). Eventually, it will be made obsolete by the release of the main branch whenever it may be ready. Until Then Enjoy!

Debug Info Editor by SirCobra (cobras_event_logger_v2.1.exe)
Version 2.1

Do you hate crashes? Do you want to help us (the WH: Geheimnisnacht team) solve the issues? In this case, you should try out this program!

Thanks to @SirCobra#7071 we have made our own version of the event logger, completely from scratch.
This program can modify the mod's decisions and events to add additional info to the game.log when they are firing (...\Documents\Paradox Interactive\Crusader Kings II\logs\game.log).
It modifies events and decisions text files to add a 'log'-line in the immediate/effect clause.

Make sure you have enabled -debugscripts in your steam launch options!

Instructions:
1. Back away if you don't know what game.log is or haven't understood the description of the program
2. Read the Warnings!
3. Back up your decisions and events
4. Put the cobras_event_logger_v2.1.exe in the same folder, where the folders "events" and "decisions" are located.
4.1 It should be noted we are talking about the location of the mod's events/decisions, not the base game! They should be located at: ...\Documents\Paradox Interactive\Crusader Kings II\mod\*your mod*
5. Run the program.
6. Press y if you want to edit the debug information.
7. Press 1 to Add Debug Info to events or press 4 to add it to decisions.
8. Make sure you have enabled -debugscripts in your steam launch options!
9. Run the game and play until a nice crash happens, look at game.log to find the bogus event.
10. When you've done testing, please report your findings.
Usually, the last lines in the game.log and error.log have caused the crash.
Upload either both files or the last lines in both files.
11. After you are done you can remove the debug info with option 7. (READ the section Warnings!)
It will remove all logs generated by this program.
12. Exit the program with option 0.s

Warnings:
1. game.log may become huge
2. The log changes some code in immediate and effect clauses, which can (but should not) cause crashes.

Additional info for modders:
1. Option 9 will only remove the lines generated by this program, but no manually generated logs.
2. If you've applied mode 1 and 4 (added commentary to both decisions and events), then the program will stay in a stable checksum rotation. This means it will always switch between the checksum of the active log and the disabled log.
It can't go back to the pre-edited checksum though, because some formatting is applied, when the program is executed for the first time.

Note:
If you have any problems with the program or you found a bug caused by the program, feel free contact me.
